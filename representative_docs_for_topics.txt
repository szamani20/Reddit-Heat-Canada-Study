Lets dispense with the notion that the government cares about those in need - people on long-term disability are expected to live on less than $1400 per month. As if the government is going to provide air conditioners. A bit of a pickle. AC makes climate change worse, but we need AC because of climate change Baffles me that it isnt mandatory for condos/townhouses to have AC units. In Toronto pretty much every building comes with AC! Fuck the heat wave, still waiting for housing policies that works. If Singapore and Vienna can do it, it just means that all three levels of municipal, provincial and federal governments are not making it happen.', 'I have been brainstorming different ways to make cities more climate resilient for climate change. I worked out the first part of it my blueprint which would be a modular or a compartmentalization of artificial intelligence on a municipally regulated blockchain, here, I am using artificial intelligence as an application into a sort of digital infrastructure integrated into the very urban fabric. It brings together certain technologies to monitor climate threats and provide real time recommendations and such a system should be easily expandable to allow for other plug and play system to develop an ai to keep our cities safe. I am hoping to argue that such a program would give legitimacy to a municipally run blockchain which would provide both new regulatory and financial powers to our urban cities. Actually, this was what I was going to run as the mayor of Toronto but I chickened out the last minute. I guess my harsh tag would have been something like #dearfordbyefalicialovetoronto I am dyslexic so please excuse my grammar. There are two things that I argue here - such an effort will give legitimacy to the blockchain, provide jobs but most importantly we develop an ecosystem for innovation especially in emerging technology. We are not only going to give Ford a fuck you, but also to meta by integrating virtual reality into a city regulated and we will enshrine into the very fabric of these system the ensure us a right to a dignified life. I did not work out all the economics here, but the idea is our ability to defend the values we most enshrine is what gives our industry a leverage. Second, we will invest those industries into a sovereign wealth fund for all of us, plus I would have turned the now legitimate blockchain to sell digital ownership of certain infrastructures of the city, as a way to raise the money to building housing and invest into climate resilient infrastructure. One of the major emergency issue I have been thinking about extreme heat - not to scare you, but analyze I did show the extreme heat days will get more severe and the numbers of days double within a decade or so. I do not believe we understand the geopolitical, economic and social ramifications of just this alone. In some ways, this system is decentralized which means we invest into our innovation allow an ecosystem to creative understand and built solutions allowing us to adapt to the shifting world orders. Onto my another point. I was at the pride parade last month - and I thought here is a good place to start. I was trying to see if we can develop an easy DYI for a passive evaporative cooling system using mist. And power it love ü§£ - by that, I mean the energy and movement. And the integration of evaporative cooling into float using cheap DYI system may help lower ambient temperatures - a net-zero energy solution. Also, the city should distribute water bottles, and find an environmental friendly way to do it. And they should ensure people have access to water during these heat waves. Education is also key - and perhaps the critical path towards making sure we do our best to take care of each other. heats strokes or other heat illness and deaths are pretty common and get incredibly little attention - In fact, integrating these educational can be as simple as a poster explaining these issues - to creative ways. In regards to the air quality - since it was brought up as an issue. Our HVAC systems would have to function differently then what we have now. Well - what we are installing is not necessarily the state of the art. But, we would have to think more long term. Nearly all of the built environment around us need to decarbonize. So designing for an intelligent response is required to optimize efficiencies, costs and reduce the embodied carbon emission. It‚Äôs important to think holistically. Like, I really liked Moshe Safdie vision with Habitat 67. Though for me, I see a financial constraint - see, a holistic solutions may to integrate the re-building of the Decarie with Habitat 67, here we would find savings in both cost and embodied carbon. Also, I was thinking of a sort of land trust with co-op style financing system for affordable home ownership which may further reduce the cost. Coming back to poor outdoor air conditions, our ventilation systems have to increase recir air and use more filters. As our housing crisis pushes people to split living rooms - we must also remember the increased probability of another pandemic, which is linked to increasing temperature and in this case, our ventilations should have to reverse and increase fresh air intake. So, here we have an opportunity for the development of an intelligent system to interface with the city‚Äôs digital infrastructure, and since the blockchain is decentralized / it would allow for plug and play system. I think a big question that is a significant gamble is if we can find the labor for this kind of innovation and I would take that gamble - as bet on us. ü¶æü¶æü¶æ indeed - as jobs becomes more automated - we need thinkers and innovators and i believe a truly shared vision will make us all a hero. And for those who do not want to work, that is alright too. In some sense I argue that the efficiencies we gain from optimizing supply/resources - which by the way is essential for an ai power climate resilience management will allow those who need a break or simply need time to figure themselves out. Plus, a great destabilization factor for our democracy is are the unseen refugee crisis that will make Merkel challenge a walk in the park - in this regard, such a digital infrastructure will allow us to better adapt. In closing, I think a key challenge for Canadian is a coherent and shared identity and perhaps it‚Äôs our ability to come together to defend the values we most hold true - and more so then every, the world seems so uncertain so why don‚Äôt we come together to built a country that will defend its values and rights of all of us no matter what is thrown to us. My blueprint is based on some research which focused on building affordable net-zero homes for remote northern communities. I scaled the framework I develop for a portfolio of 30 buildings. I suppose for me the next step is find a town to do a pilot, preferably a small town or community then scale it up. I guess the idea is to scale it up from small communities into urban areas, which will allow piloting and feedback. Any takers? Lol Also, integration of virtual reality and ai, we can disrupt everything. Disrupt health, disrupt education, disrupt foreign policy and disrupt. My vision here really is to see if we can collective built an ability to provide a basically level of human rights, and emergency management through a digital infrastructure. Before even a disaster strikes - we can overlay a digital systems alerting the world to stand by - we can save millions of lives. It also our defense policy and we can provide basically level of education across the whole world and do it making a lot of money. I think ü§î I am proposing we commodify empathy. Also - I definitely think as a nation, we need to mature and that means As a nation, it‚Äôs time we live up to the ideals we believe us to be.', ' Two years after deadly heat dome, B.C. still has no program to provide air conditioners to those in need; The province was supposed to complete a review last year, but it is already 5¬Ω months overdue  Hey!

Topic -1: 'In the meantime, turn on the oven at 450F and leave the door slightly open. Use a fan to distribute the heat. Whats the temperature? No source but I think 17 is the legal minimum.

Buy a thermometer, record temperatures and take your landlord to court Cest le moment de chauffer lappartement avec ton four! Je pensais avoir tout entendu en termes de propri√©taires de merde... This can be very dangerous. If it goes below freezing, the pipes will freeze and burst. From there, the water from the burst pipe can start an electrical fire if it touches the wiring, possibly combusting the entire apartment with people inside. I would call a city inspector if I were you. Buy an appropriate heater that is safe to leave on at night (important) and never ever rent with the heating included ever again. Just my $0.02.... Dont run the oven door open like others mentioned, and space heaters have the same effect - the air will be too dry and your nose/skin will suffer. Instead, put a bunch of pots filled with water on the stove and let them boil away for 45 minutes before refilling and repeat. this will add some moisture along with the heat. have a small fan move the air around the apt. Stop paying rent. Landlord isnt providing what theyre supposed to so you shouldnt either. Your landlord is indeed a POS but it might be a little crazy to use the word hypothermia here. I think your SO is sick if he wakes up shivering. Its barely been below zero at all yet. I think I turned the heat on like twice this year, its currently 18 degrees in my apartment. Theres no way your place is as cold as outside unless theres literally holes in every wall. Holy shit. That sucks ass. Hope you can keep safe and warm. Good luck.

The $130-million horticultural attraction, which opened in Assiniboine Park in December, was forced to close for a few hours Sunday, when exterior sun and heat caused temperatures inside the purposefully hot facility to skyrocket. At noon June 3, one of the heat sensors inside the centre ‚Äî built with glass exterior walls and a roof made of translucent ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (plastic) ‚Äî showed 43 C. Environment and Climate Change Canada reported the city‚Äôs temperature at 31.5 C, at that time, with a humidex of 39. An email sent to people who pre-purchased or booked admission tickets for Sunday stated: ‚ÄúDue to high heat, the biomes at the Leaf have been temporarily closed for the safety and comfort of staff, volunteers and visitors. We hope to re-open later today, if/when the temperatures return to a safe level.‚Äù The Leaf re-opened after about three hours, after rain began falling and temperatures dropped. Thomas Rempel-Ong, a Winnipegger who has an annual membership for the Leaf and nearby Assiniboine Park Zoo, was there Sunday with his family. He said he was dumbfounded the brand-new building could not handle the heat of a day weeks short of actual summer. ‚ÄúIt seems like the facility can‚Äôt keep people cool, at a temperature we consistently reach every single summer?‚Äù Rempel-Ong said Monday. ‚ÄúSo we as Canadians spent millions of dollars subsidizing the construction of this facility? Plus, people now have to pay for admission versus the previous conservatory, which was free to enter. ‚ÄúSounds like somebody was negligent in their duty when drafting the plan for this building‚Ä¶ What would happen if school kids or seniors came down with heat stroke while visiting the Leaf?‚Äù Laura Cabak, a spokeswoman for Assiniboine Park Conservancy, which oversees the Leaf and zoo, confirmed the facility closed its doors at about 11:45 a.m. After rain cooled everything down, it was able to re-open at about 2:45 p.m. The facility closes seven days a week at 9 p.m. ‚ÄúOur ability to cool the biomes is limited by the outside air temperature,‚Äù Cabak said, adding there is air conditioning only for the restaurant, office and event spaces, and butterfly biome. ‚ÄúAs we are in our first year of operations, we are still learning how the building responds to changing weather conditions and how best to manage that using the available environmental control systems. These systems include evaporative cooling ‚Äî (for) example, misting ‚Äî and natural fresh air ventilation.‚Äù Cabak said one of the facility‚Äôs temperature sensors, in the Mediterranean biome, showed a temperature reading of 43 C. However, all other sensors had a peak average of 33.7 C. ‚ÄúWe are reviewing our protocols and will continue to make adjustments to manage the temperatures within the biomes to the best of our ability and minimize the impact on visitation, but will close if necessary out of concern for the health and safety of staff, volunteers and visitors,‚Äù she said. Carla Hrycyna, co-owner of St. Mary‚Äôs Nursery and Garden Centre in Winnipeg, is no stranger to hot summer days and a greenhouse. ‚ÄúWe are well-ventilated and a lot of our buildings have wide-open roofs,‚Äù Hrycyna said Monday. ‚ÄúWhen we get to extreme temperatures, we put fans on and we get out there‚Ä¶ We also have the area vented overnight to get the cooler air. It‚Äôs still very, very hot, but we find most people only go out there for short periods on hot days.‚Äù Molly McCracken, a volunteer with grassroots group No User Fees at Diversity Gardens, which was critical about having admission fees at a facility built with tax dollars, said the heat-related closure was ‚Äúunfortunate.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was a large amount of public money that went into the building and it has to be said whether the building is right for this climate,‚Äù McCracken said. ‚ÄúA massive building like this needs to have a climate study done before it is built.‚Äù Monies used to build the Leaf could have been used to keep city libraries and community centres open to cool people off during hot days, she added. Rempel-Ong said he is lucky because, between his annual pass and living just a few blocks away, he can go to the Leaf whenever it is open. However, tourists or people in other areas of the city might be upset if they find it closed because of high temperatures, he added. ‚ÄúFrom the outside, it is a beautiful piece of architecture,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is stunning. I‚Äôm sure it will be a showstopper. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre saying now you didn‚Äôt build it for people to be comfortable to be inside in the summer, then somebody should be fired.‚Äù'

Topic 1: 'However its been the worst fire season ever for the country, lots of droughts as well. The trend in the National average temperature is unmistakable. Climate denial? What is this, the early 2000s? Maybe not, but the water in my local lake system is historically low. Heat wave or not. But we have to push climate change so we can tax you guys more and make sure you own nothing so we can feel big If you dont mind, Im gonna go ahead and panic anyway Vancouver, where the sea is that is warming up. Besides the fires and more tornado warnings than previous years‚Ä¶ it does feel normal (Ontario)‚Ä¶ maybe even a little cooler. My grass is still green and healthy. Climate change is real‚Ä¶ but maybe Canada will be in a better situation than most. However, mild summers and mild winters combined are a bit worrying, last winter was mild! Just stop the climate change denial already. It is a thing, you selfish idiots.  Im in Northern BC. Its never been this hot here before. What claim from this news article specifically are you doubting? With regards to the temperatures they measured, they were referencing the number of days above 30¬∞C, normally it is 16, this year its been 36. July was colder than normal, June was exceptionally hotter than normal. Climate is shifting and has been for decades Never heard once about Canadian heat waves in July, just making shit up again‚Ä¶ Unfortunately no one will believe this if they even see it Watch out for that global boiling! Thanks for the insight Are we just totally against science and fact in this sub? K, cool. You guys continue to amaze me. Thank god Canada isn‚Äôt on the same planet as these poor buggers.  I thought it was a beautiful summer. Quite fond of this "global warming" Most cities on this chart were above average for the entire month. These arent minor changes but maybe a sign of the new normal. Lets not forget, even fractions of a degree have an impact. What, I thought Canada was on fire. üôÑ [removed] Climate change denialism is so hot right now. It‚Äôs ridiculous not 1 journalist has done a story about this. The water off the coast of Florida was 38C. Thats hot', 'Wildfire Smoke, Air Quality and Heat Risk info **Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality** Well unfortunately we have a new regular season we didn‚Äôt have when I was a kid growing up in Victoria sixty-odd years ago ‚Äì the wildfire smoke and heat wave season - which may start any day now because most of the fire smoke in Victoria comes from elsewhere. For example you can see via the link below how the smoke from the current Alberta wildfires reaches all the way to the United States east coast. Please note that I am not a professional nor an academic but just a geek interested in weather and climate. Also I do not know if/how any of these sites work on phones. There may be no smoke now but you might want to bookmark this page for that later date when you see the horizon turn yellow or think you smell smoke. The main issue for us in Victoria is wind direction as the fires will be in the interior, down south or up island. Normally the winds are in our favor but that is not always the case. If you‚Äôre new here you may not know that smoke from elsewhere can get so bad here as to make normal functioning difficult and be a real health risk to vulnerable people. Below are some handy ways of seeing wildfire smoke related information. Note that some of these sites will flash their images at first but that will stop after a few seconds once all the images are loaded. Well start simple with the official Environment Canada current Air Quality Index and forecast for Victoria. **If youre looking for AQ related health information** go to any of these sites... CBC has a good page with all kinds of related info here Also you can go to the link below and see the winds that are driving the smoke. You can also view air quality on this map and tons of other related stuff. Real time AQ can also be found here. I like the historical and forecast info this site provides. For BC travelers you will find AQ values for other locations in BC here. If you want to see AQ worldwide this map is interesting. Hold the Ctrl key to zoom. You can also see worldwide and local AQ info on this site with a globe you can rotate and zoom #current/particulates/isobaric/850hPa/overlay=pm2.5/orthographic=254.69,43.54,779 Click on the word EARTH in the lower left for options. Given the regularity of the problem now a great many smoke/fire sites have been created. Here are a few others‚Ä¶ (click the ‚ÄúOverlays‚Äù link) The following link will show you smoke **forecast** maps. In the "Vertically Integrated Smoke" row click on the "Loop" check-mark in that row to see an animation. **Heat Risk** **On June 28, 2021 the temperature reading at Victoria‚Äôs Gonzales Point hit 39.8 degrees.** There were sixteen heat-related deaths in Victoria over the course of that particular heat wave. So yes, it can happen here. I‚Äôll be seventy this year and I‚Äôve lived in Victoria for about sixty of those years. I‚Äôve seen the climate here steadily warming. The weather forecasters are already warning 2023 could be a particularly warm summer. Here is a BC Gov website with all kinds of good info about what to do before and during a heat wave... ...and the related BC Centre for Disease Control site However as shown in the film series linked below the main danger is that as you get hotter you become increasingly confused and make worse and worse decisions. All the things that could go wrong are detailed in this series. **The series is intended as educational material, not entertainment**, something I know because I have corresponded with the producers. I am a strong supporter of this approach because I believe people learn and remember best from stories. This series shows what happens to people during a fictional heat wave in Amsterdam. It will help you understand what you and your neighbors might go through in a worst case scenario. Infants, pregnant women, pets, the elderly. It is in Dutch with subtitles and each of the the twelve episodes is less than ten minutes long. Some swearing and suggestive scenes. Its Amsterdam after all. **NOTE** Although my intention with this post was simply to provide information to those with possible concerns over wildfire smoke or heat events in Victoria it is not surprising that the discussion has spilled over into opinions regarding the wider issue of climate change. If you are concerned about the impacts of climate change in our region the ‚ÄúFuture Impacts‚Äù section of this BC Government webpage will be of interest. ', '(ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT YOUTUBE VIDEOS TO SEE FOR THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OUR NATION‚ÄôS FUTURE, PLEASE SHARE) This is honestly a video that anyone into politics or climate change or national defence policy or future planning at all in Canada NEEDS to see for the implications alone, trust me this is not clickbait, I wish it was, and the PBS Terra team also did a great editing job. Also check out the sister channels of PBS Eons and PBS Space/time if you want for more intellectual stimulation. This video is far more important than almost anything else online right now, not hyperbole or lies, it will cut down through all the incessant, grating, distracting noise of the world to show you the plain truth of the coming threat. There‚Äôs not much more worth fighting for than this. This is a combination of objective fact, and also making well founded predictions based on leading climatologists and some of their most recent primary research via comparison to paleoclimates. More Canadians need to see this‚Ä¶ Like if there was a video that could more appropriately be renamed to ‚ÄòThe Truth of the World‚Äô I have yet to see it. We are rapidly unravelling the entire Earth System out of whack. Can we use this to found a new thought worm to spread around, or ‚Äòreligion‚Äô, the ‚Äòsacred text‚Äô of Objectivism or Rationalism or just non-Crazyism? I would very much like that no matter how bad the rest of the world gets, for truth to at least have a cultural victory in the end after thousands of years of cults and lies. Basically, to put it another way, let us all agree to open our eyes and LET THE UNIVERSE EXPERIENCE ITSELF for potentially one of the first times in history as evolved life on a beautiful planet. I have no wish to be ignorant again. They got us here and made us what we are so we cannot pretend like they aren‚Äôt things, but also ended up doing us great harm and we no longer need them so we should start trying to get off our supply and fast. From now on let us make all policy decisions on logic rather than delusion (support Israel at all costs so they can get killed again for the end times! Yes I am a rational geopolitical figure and not a cultist in the eyes of the world, somehow!) and mythology (why do some provinces have those catholic school systems?) and hate (Golly gee I am the premier of NB and have been tanking in the polls ever since I decided to run over a union popular with the more moderate Maritime people, let me consult my iffy pastor at the Kennebecasis Valley Baptist Church and- sorry I mean let me hire a right-wing political consultant from out west and start marginalizing Trans rights in our schools while violating the Charter by having my education minister specifically say we are targeting a protected class, did I forget to mention my Public Safety minister named Kris Austin (license plate obsessed Baptist minister who spends his day inserting ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô into as many quotes as possible from Minto and likely meditates to documentaries on the Acadian Expulsion) betrayed and left his own extremist party to die before they were able to take away Bilingual rights, to suck up to me and join my PC party to keep his seat, and now his proudest moment is getting an unneeded jail spawned from ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô Facebook memes and wedge issues built in his dying, coal-forsaken, Single Tim Hortons, swamp of a community?

Go Blaine!) to be fair he was born in a town called ‚ÄòForest City‚Äô of like 100 people with a crazy church and spent his life as an Irving Oil exec and thus had been indoctrinated into religious, industrial and economical cults all his life, so expecting him to live in reality is a bit unfair and I do feel bad for people like him a bit, he was never given the chance as a youth to grow tolerance really and I imagine reality coming up against his ‚Äòreality‚Äô must be making him very angry and confused personally as a sort of existential crisis and it can only be expected that accepting some online conspiracy is an inevitably in similar situations around the world and Canada. and greed (Infinite. Damn. Growth. Is. Delusional. Also head of the PC party in Ontario directly linked to developers as part of a mob organization was fine to the apathy of Ontario apparently, now the RCMP have to step in where VOTERS FAILED) as has sadly largely been the case up until now, shall we? If I could just suggest one thing after the feeling of horror you may have after the end of the video, and the fact that it is quickly becoming clear that the future climate models being touted by the IPCC and national governments have been extremely too conservatively biased for years (just like politics and economics in general, thanks in large part to the poison and delusional claims of religion, how else but a CULT-ural default into CULTS can you explain believing in INFINITE GROWTH IN A PETRI DISH for hundreds of years?)‚Ä¶..you may want to consider becoming a lil‚Äô bit of a climate radical in your voting preferences. It‚Äôs up to you though. And let‚Äôs try and stop letting fringe Russian bots make both sides of objective reality and poison an entire political culture, okay? Sometimes on an issue one side is completely delusional wrong no matter how good they feel about it. It‚Äôs from dopamine rushes in our ape brains due to the natural human biological tendency for addiction and socialization and cults over millions of years. And unrelated, but just to pile on, Slava Ukraine, good work on your recent drone swarm on the Black Sea Fleet, your commando detonation of the main Crimean missile base, your earlier sinking of the main ship of the fleet WITHOUT HAVING A NAVY and a recent and constant swarm of drones into the lavish and oligarchic skyscrapers of Moscow. Good work and you are making Russia look like the mafia religious cultists that they are and have been for years now when we thought they were a true foe. Best of luck. (Try to SPREAD THE WORD about this coming CRISIS to those who need to hear it especially in the Maritimes, PLEASE, I‚Äôd imagine even one metre of a surge risks cutting off NS by the Trans-Canada Highway from all the rest of Canada and making it a virtual island at the Chignecto Isthmus? And judging by Google the only other crossing is a small bridge right above the ocean up in Tidnish, this could be a DIRE SITUATION. Not to mention the confederation bridge approach to PEI is a causeway on what looks like a SWAMPY ISLAND on the NB side, is PEI about to become a ‚Äòtrue island‚Äô again with one long extension out to the south?? Oh and don‚Äôt forget Cape Breton has the potential to become an island^2 if the Canso Causeway is overwhelmed eventually, do you see the existential threats to 3/4 Atlantic Provinces now? I am saying even a relatively MINOR sea level rise could rip out the vital arteries of the consumerist societies of NS and PEI and maybe even Cape Breton and in part Newfoundland, and that really NB IS SAFER THAN THE REST OF ATLANTIC CANADA by far for supplies. At least those Newfoundland shores are so damn rocky and vertical that the sea rise will barely be noticed in some areas, heh, it‚Äôs gonna be the rocky and craggy shoreline areas that make it out better than gentle and flat beaches and estuaries in general in the coming decades and YOU GUYS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND in your decision making and either individual planning or policy planning if anyone important is reading this essay)'

Topic 0: 'I changed to a cold climate heat pump in Toronto, with a gas furnace backup, with reliance, heres my two cents It was hard to find actual information regarding this when I was trying to do my research. Is this worth the investment? So Im sharing my experience after Ive made the switch. I just did it last week but I hope someone will find this useful. In short, I just changed to a cold climate air to air trane heat pump with a trane gas furnace backup. After some rough rough dummy dummy estimates, id expect to see around $300 decrease overall in energy bill this year. Is this worth the extra cost? Thats to be find out a few years from now. If you are thinking about heat pumps, please read on. &#x200B; 1. Real working temperature The heat pump says its "cold climate" and "handles outside temperature from -30c". After the installation, on my ecobee thermostat setting, I discovered that the heat pump is set to absolutely stop working when the temperature is below -9.4c (this setting is called compressor minimum outdoor temperature). The gas furnace is set to not work above 3c. The equipment says it works until -30c, but I was told the -9.4c setting is the most optimal setting for efficiency aka money saving. So in reality, this heat pump will work for about 4.5 month or so in the winter(Oct, Nov, Dec, half Jan and April) and the same old gas furnace will work for the colder month. The savings from your energy bills will be from those 4.5 month in reality. I personally wasnt even aware of the situation until after the installation and I think there maybe other models out there that are better or worse. So make sure to do your research on that particular model number and ask directly with your sales. Or even share your information on the comments to help others! &#x200B; 2. Heat Pump performance I only ran it for a few days and last week Toronto wasnt that cold, around 0c. I noticed that the heat pump had to work pretty hard at night, and BARELY keeping the temperature only around 19c instead of the 20c i set it to. If you feel the air coming out of the vents, heat pump air is no where near as hot as furnace air. But the small small plus side is that its also not that dry. During the day it feels pretty good but the heat pump is barely even working. Ive yet to see how much of an impact this will drive up my electricity bill. &#x200B; 3. Actual savings from Oct, Nov, Dec, half Jan and Apr Last year, I used in cubic meters, 118 oct/210 nov/283 dec/300 jan/171 apr. In summer days I use about less than 20 per month, probably from water heating and stuff. Using this calculator Theres a fixed charge even if you dont use gas. So to eliminate the fixed cost every month, i use the cost of winter month minus the 20 cubic meter all year round cost, which is $36. This translates to $48($84 for using 118 cubic meter of gas minus $36)+55+130+70(only half)+75 = $378 of gross saving. Now I need to subtract an increase in electricity bill to reflect the actual net saving. I have no idea how much of an increase that will be, so Ill look to see in the future. This could change if the heat pump could work more during the colder days. Assuming it costs about $20 bucks extra to run the heat pump every month, Id be looking at a saving thats close to $280 \\~ 300. 4. How is the brand Trane? Not stating my opinion, simply stating facts, what I personally experienced. When I realized the actual working temperature for the heat pump was -9.4c, I tried to find more information on that. On Tranes own website, I was able to find my model number and there was a link to an energy guide. But the link takes me to a page not found. So I called Trane and asked for an energy guide and I was told, they can not provide that to me and I had to contact my installer. I have yet to receive an actual energy guide on there. Heres the website to my model If you click on view model specifications, you can find a little link to "energy guide"(guideless). &#x200B; 5. How is Reliance? Again not stating my opinion, simply stating facts, what I personally experienced. My furnace was down and I called Reliance for repairs, and the repair guy told me it was the heat exchanger having a leak and deemed it unrepairable. So he hooked me up with a Reliance comfort "advisor". The "advisor" came that night and stayed till late. I appreciate it, which is largely why I went through with this. When I asked, do cold climate heat pumps work in -30c? He told me, a cars speedometer can run at 240 but nobody is driving it at 240, and these heat pumps will only work until -10c or -15c or so. In comparison, he told me a not cold climate heat pump says it could work at -10c but really it probably doesnt work after 0c. Yet after the installation, I discovered the heat pump is set to absolutely not work below -9.4C. Guess he wasnt too far off lol. If the heat pump could work until -15C optimally, then I could save on a couple more month, which would be 50% more increase in savings. When I asked about how much would it save me? He said more than $500 per year. When I asked how is that based on, he answered me "trust me" "Ive done this and all my customers are telling me that". Sweet, its based on a gut feeling. I had to do my own research, and unfortunately there was nothing to help me getting an estimate. I found this but it lacks so much information on how the numbers are being derived from. (It has a long report in the website but I wasnt able to find any point when I glanced through that report. If you cant summarize a report in a few lines thats a shit report.) The installation guys all had shoes on in my home. Yah. They ended up drilling 3 holes on my finished basement wall and didnt repair it. I was instructed to buy "mud" and cover the holes myself. Yah. But the holes arent that big, and they worked hard labor for a couple days, so I sucked that up. No biggie, Im DIY guy. I signed the deal overnight but when I woke up the next morning I had alot of unanswered questions and I was having second thoughts. The installation guys came to my door with the equipment and my wife was told that there will be a charge if we backed up then. I even got a quote that was a little cheaper from another major company and a different heat pump/furnace brand. But I went ahead anyways with Reliance because I felt bad for the guys that showed up, since if I cancelled it, they wouldnt get paid for the whole day. Generally, when you speak with an "advisor". Im the dumb dumb and the advisor should be the expert. But in this case, I had to read different reports, do my own cost analysis and crunch my own numbers and my "advisor"s only advise is "trust me". I had to answer my own questions and convince myself. &#x200B; So, this is my two cents. Hopefully this will help someone in a similar situation. Please share more experiences, there are currently too little information on heat pumps and their actual costs. &#x200B;', 'The tl/dr. Installed 3 heat pumps. Electricity bill has gone down significantly And not burning any wood which is a further savings. I sleep better. My air is filtered now. Dont worry about wildfire smoke. A wood fire has gone from cost saving, stressful necessity to luxury expense for ambiance. I have now installed 3 heat pumps at my place. I am all in with this technology. Ill do my best to answer honestly without my excitement spilling over. The basics are that I have a 40 year old house. Northern Ontario. Not great insulation due to high cathedral ceilings and very big, south facing windows overlooking the lake. Pretty but not very efficient. The house is heated with electric baseboard as primary. No furnace or ducting. Early 2000s electric heat was way more than propane or oil. Now propane is most expensive, then oil, then electricity and cheapest is wood. Until these modern heat pumps. Really good Napoleon wood stove that burns all winter long to keep costs down. I also keep the stand alone 3 car, insulated garage heated with another Napoleon wood stove. Total wood consumption is 15 cords a year. 4.5 for the garage and 11 for the house. Wood cost have gone up and are now $140 a cord hardwood. I do it cheaper and get a transport worth of logs dropped off and cut and split it all myself. Runs about 75$ a cord plus my labour. Same price as a Goodlife membership but no yoga pants. Just an axe and a chainsaw. I installed a 3 head arctic series a2a heat pump this summer strictly for the air conditioning. Weather has been getting hotter and had to keep the windows closed at night due to the extreme amount of wild fire smoke. I had considered for years running a coil down into the lake and have a water based heat pump for the house. Costed out at about 23K$ with me doing most of the work. Really long payback but that was the most efficient way to heat and cool long term even just a few years back. Not anymore. I Bought the first one I could get that came pre charged with refrigerant. Shipped from Quebec. Spent a couple of bucks more on the newer model that is listed to work down to -30c (yeah sure I thought, whatever) will keep me cool at least and take the edge off the heating spring and fall. I have a bit of mechanical skills and was able to easily instal the whole 3 head system. 2 pole, 30amp breaker, 10/2 wire in conduit, disconnect box. Whip, line sets and covers. All in cost me $3850 CAD. I have a vacuum pump already and used inert welding gas to pressure test the system up to 350psi before evacuating the lines. Not too hard to install. I have been blown away at how well it works. I really only need the air condition for about 10-14 days a year but it is amazingly comfortable now. What impressed me most is the heat. We had a cold snap in late October and the heat kept coming. I did a bunch more research on the efficiencies and decided to go all in for the same brand. I installed a 12kbtu single head unit for the garage (1270$ all in with breaker, wire, wall mount) and a 30k btu two head unit on the other side of the house ($3530 all in). Installed them both myself. I cant believe how well they work. Weve had 2 nights now at -18c and these units are nowhere near capacity. My garage is set at 60f and is perfect temperature all the time. Have not burned a stick of wood in the stove out there. The house is much more even and very comfortable at 71 compared to the wood stove and baseboards. Will see if these units work right down to -30. Been talking to the tech guys at the company. Have been assured that these units will work at full heat capacity down to -25c and then will still produce heat but maybe not enough down to -30c. So heres the rundown. I just got my electric bill for the month of November. My electricity usage has gone DOWN significantly from last November. Over 100$ less for the month and I have not burned a single fire yet. I am also heating my garage without any wood. So not only have I saved 100$ in electricity, Ive saved at least 2 cords of wood at 280$ I figure the savings in electricity come from the fact that I would normally have baseboards on in the basement and also in a couple of bedrooms where the wood stove heat doesnt reach. The other reason my electricity has gone down is that these units are running at an average COP of 3.6. So for every 1$ of electricity I put into my baseboards, I get exactly 1$ worth of heat out of them. With the heat pumps, for every 1$ worth of electricity I put in, I get back 3.60$ worth of heat. Amazing. Here are some final thoughts. I love the cool, dry even temperature during the summer. I never had that. Had an old window shaker that was loud and not efficient at all. I love that it filters the air and I sleep so much better with no stress. I used to watch the temperature, open all the windows at night for a cool breeze off the lake and close them all during the day. My house is under the forest canopy so really only get about 4 hours of direct sun on the roof in summer. Has worked well enough for 20 odd years but things seem to be getting hotter and Im getting older. I have also had to undergo a complete change in mindset. I was always stressed keeping the wood stove going all winter. I burned wood because it was about 2/3 the cost compared to heating with the baseboards. Checking forecast to see when I could shut it down and clean out the ashes. I never fully realized how much dust the fire place emits into the house. I can dust now and things stay clean. The big change in mindset is that I dont need to run the stove. I only have a fire when I want. Mostly for ambiance now when guests are over. I have gone from needing it to save money to, now, wanting a fire sometimes but knowing that it is actually costing me more money than just using electricity. Burning wood has become a luxury expense. Mind blown. Oh, last thing. I didnt do any government rebates or anything. Fuck that. They take forever to get energy audits. Have to pay all costs up front. And get screwed on the price of install by the local companies. (looking at you Noll Climate Care). My neighbours had a system installed at their house 2 years ago by a local company. Same size as my 36k btu unit. Cost them up front $22k total and got rebates back for about 4500$ The kicker is, they are elderly and got double screwed. Their system only works down to -12c. All the stickers and branding were removed from their unit so we dont even know what kind it is. The grants are great if you have a reliable company, have a specialty system you want installed and dont have the capacity to do it yourself. I highly suggest installing 90% of the system yourself and then hiring an electrician to wire it in and an HVAC guy to purge the lines and fill the gas. The tl/dr. Installed 3 heat pumps.

Topic 4: 'Why arent we forcing them to lower profits? Few companie are going to agree to a long-term reduction in profits out of the goodness of their hearts I‚Äôm not in Canada but our local grocery store for a rib eye steak was $25‚Ä¶. I ended up just buying a head lettuce and broccoli instead. So sad. With all these price cuts, the only way companies can sustain margins is to cut pay. So its a good things all those employees went ahead and unionized . . . I also went from a boycott Walmart to occasional shopper. When they undercut Asian store on Asian snacks, I turned back to boycott Walmart. Ive honestly noticed nowadays that regular Canadian grocery stores are mostly empty while places like Wal-Mart and Costco are always packed. I only see it getting more busy with these price cuts. But its honestly so necessary in Canada. We need more foreign competition to force Canadian monopolies to cut costs and increase quality. Thats literally one of the reasons capitalism was invented; to allow competition where the best services and best prices come out on top. Save on price hikes are the worst . Insane . "Save on savers " the add says . Ha ha , No seriously , they are very high priced . Horrible . Like JT or not, he brought them to Ottawa and put them on notice. Time will show if this does anything Screw these Canadian chains. I‚Äôve been so diligent trying to buy Canadian products from Canadian retailers for what? Them to screw me on prices? Walmart and Costco it is. "Canadian government asks foreign corporations to control basic human rights (again), they are happy to do so (again)." As a Canadian,I couldn‚Äôt give two shits what Walmart & members only Costco.I don‚Äôt shop there. Dark Trudeau is winning again! Right wingers gonna freak that their corps can‚Äôt keep greedflation going. Watch the comments fly in now‚Ä¶ lol They realize there is a huge competitive advantage to lowering prices. Soo.. JT did something good?.. Their inflation was way more then 4%. ‚ÄúOw! Ow! Okay okay! Let go!‚Äù - How Canadians see Grocers, probably. Costco still isnt bad, a few bucks here and there, this is still lovely news of course.', ' Walmart and Costco Agree to ‚ÄòAggressive‚Äô Price Cuts on Food After Canada Turns Up the Heat  Meat, seafood and produce we shop at Asian supermarkets Bulk items we buy at Costco Everything in between is Walmart. Let me guess, non-essential condiments and highly processed food. Oh maybe throw in an item from the expired vegetables. Canadian grocery companies steal from Canadians Walmart and Costco are already the two that didn‚Äôt profiteer as much as the other grocers during inflation. Their price increases have been more modest than Loblaws, Sobeys or Save-On. I don‚Äôt feel bad shopping at Walmart for groceries now after seeing how the Canadian chains price gouged Canadians. I live within minutes of Superstore, Save on foods, and Walmart. Pre-covid I‚Äôd make an effort go to Superstore or Save On over Walmart. Not anymore! Yeah‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶ get back to me when Loblaws or Sobeys are forced to do the same. Sick of this ‚ÄúAmerican companies are the enemy‚Äù mentality while Canadian monopolies rob us blind What about Sobeys and Loblaws because those are the ones who are really screwing us over. Bring back price matching Walmart, you cowards Watch the packaging size plummet again . As a Canadian, I would be absolutely giddy and thrilled to see Wal-Mart and Costco absolutely fucking slaughter Loblaws, Sobeys, and Metro *and* all of their dog shit subsidiaries. Not the Weston‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Sobeys price gouging has been drastic So I‚Äôm guessing the rest of them didn‚Äôt agree to price cuts? Why is it just the American companies lowering prices? 1.4kg of chicken breast at Walmart is $23. 1.4kg of chicken breast at Thrifty Foods is $34. You mean they increased prices and then ‚Äúlower them‚Äù I‚Äôll be taking my receipts to the grocery store to compare. And will report any changes in prices Fuck supporting Canadian companies when Chinese and American companies are the one giving us fair prices My concerns are theyll change packaging sizes or quality to achieve this lower cost. The 2 American companies, already the cheapest option, are agreeing to get even cheaper than our actually Canadian grocers? Talking to the Pepsi guy & he says Pepsi/Frito Lay are price gauging but you didn‚Äôt hear it from him.', 'Foreign corporations to the rescue?.... What is this reality were living in? The plot is getting a bit ridiculous now.   I can see why Canadian corporations are so desperate to keep American corporations out of the country. Why havent prices risen at Dollarama??? Hmmmmmm ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è So I says, I says, anyways here‚Äôs wonderwall‚Ä¶.. *doubt* What‚Äôs really interesting is the comment regarding grocers in Europe going after the brands for shrinkflation. I didn‚Äôt understand that the lays chips having less in the bag or the shampoo bottle being 50ml less but costing the same is the doing of the brands and manufacturers themselves. I just connected it to the grocers. So the American stores lead in price cuts yet the Canadian grocery chains are silent. Disgusting how Canadian grocery chains with RECORD PROFITS say they will hold the line but American grocery chains say price cuts. Boycotts are the only way to get there attention. BS... I just got 2L milk for 8 bucks from Walmart.. I was like wtf! only peanut butter and chips were a dollar less that loblaws and Sobeys Save on Foods and Quality Foods are both culprits. ü§∑ Now let‚Äôs turn up the heat on the Bank of Canada. The two least evil groceries lol‚Ä¶ empire and Loblaws will laugh and give us the finger. That‚Äôs why I only shop at Walmart and Costco except for emergencies. The real reason so many Canadian industries gouge us and are terrible is a lack of competition. Groceries, airlines, cell phones.. Canadians get the shaft because of a bizarre protectionism to keep people like Galen Weston in monopolies. We need competition to make these markets better. Canadian grocers are the worst Maybe Canada can stop overtaxing people to supplement its overspending. Simplest solution would be a law that no food item can be sold for more than x% above cost. Costco I believe never charges more than 15% above cost (more often less) and they aren‚Äôt exactly hurting. They‚Äôre markups pay for overhead and the membership fees are their profit. Obviously regular grocery stores couldn‚Äôt survive on that type of margin, but if it was sat 25%, it would ensure there was no bullshit pricing, or gouging. Forever. For all food items. one problem solved'

Topic 3: 'The graph is tongue-in-cheek but in a way that a teenager would think is profound (no offense to teenagers). Otherwise its as technically wrong as it is insulting to dupe Saskatchewan voters into thinking something called CarBoN tAX faIrNEss is a worthwhile gambit. At the end of the day Moe is gambling with your money and telling you to be happy with a reduced payout. Its time for something different. Can I stop paying PST? What about those of us in rural areas who have to heat with propane? Any relief for us? But we won‚Äôt get the CAI payment then. all this does is help large companies etc the average homeowner gets more back than they pay in which is how the system is designed. the bought and paid for conservatives in this country only want to axe the tax to help their owners not the average canadian Sadly, once again, its the lower income families who will suffer most. Its well documented that lower income families benefit most from the carbon tax and its associated paybacks. Moes putting the burden of pollution back on the people, giving the wealthy a break. Thanks Scott. We see you. We know what youre doing. Thats $600 leass than the Federal rebate. Nice going Scott, youve proven that your cultists are as dumb as you. I pay 60 bucks a month in carbon tax on my gas bill. I‚Äôm on equalized payments and have a credit during summer but it‚Äôs all used over winter As we enjoy this overly warm winter in a drought. Our government should be more concerned on how to deal with the crop insurance program thats going to bankrupt this province over the next few years. They have no plans, just more anti-Trudeau cult garbage! Congrats youll get less money back but dont worry fascist oil loving baby Jebus will be so proud all your prayers will be answered lol This better not fuck over my carbon tax rebate that is helping pay for my solar panels. Sorry Scotty, the market is actually a good thing. Taxing people more on certain things to help motivate changes in behaviour is actually good. Its why Preston Manning and the Reform Party were in favour of it and pushed for it back in the day.', ' Sask. premier says province will stop collecting carbon levy on electric heat  Im completely ool, why is there CT on electricity in Sask? Is their elec mainly generated by fossil fuel? I think the argument can be made that a "cut out" in another part of the country is put in place due to high costs, Saskatchewan has a valid argument to make that it is unfair for its residents to not have the same. I have no doubts there are people in Saskatchewan who will face high home heating costs. Meanwhile Saskatchewan Budget is in a $250 million dollar deficit and they have only had one budget surplus in 9 years. Honestly who gives a shit whatever Moe does, his carbon tax focus is just misdirection for his failure. He actually promised the province a $1 billion dollar surplus and has not delivered any of that. But whatever I hope the trip to Dubai for COP28 to meet with O&G execs goes well because right now they have completely fucked up that provinces budget. A province mind you that contains 1/3 of the worlds uranium supply. A province that was holds Potash one of the most valuable agricultural products on the planet. Saskatchewan should be still feeling the boom of its resources markets, but instead is in deficit again. But yeah spend your time fing around with the Feds about climate change policy and saying you are protecting Sask Family interests. When the biggest cost to Sasks. pocket book right now is Crop insurance due to a massive drought that is being exacerbated by climate change. Idiot isnt even a good capitalist. But yeah hard slow stupid claps on his nonwithstanding clause. Im not sure it will work out well for Moe if provincial residents, or groups/professions, take his lead and start not complying with laws/regulations they dont agree with. What about that extra 1% they added to PST when Scott moe took over. The same year they also decreased corporate tax. Sask. residents are about to pay a lot of money in legal fees for the province to fight and lose to the feds in court. Can individuals just stop paying tax I Saskatchewan, if laws dont matter anymore? Sounds like a great idea. Is Moe still drinking? Moe lawyers to pay.', '>Also starting this month, Saskatchewan is no longer collecting the carbon levy from those who use electricity to heat their homes. >However, the province doesn‚Äôt anticipate legal ramifications for that move, because it controls the carbon levy that applies to its electrical utility, SaskPower. Why on earth was a carbon levy being applied to electricity when thats what what carbon levy are supposed to be steering us towards? Even if electricity is being generated by coal burning, tend user has zero control over how electcity is produced. [removed] Fuck yeah now scrap the whole thing. They aren‚Äôt getting the carbon tax rebate lol Good, someone has to start calling this bullshit out for what it is, just another government money grab. You want to make a difference as a government, stop taxing and banning things, let the free market solve things instead of endlessly virtue signaling as a government. The feds could start buy using more potash from Saskatchewan instead of importing more than $100 million of it from Russia, whom we supposedly sanction. Perhaps build a pipeline for Alberta oil to reach the East instead of importing billions from Saudia Arabia, the fucking list goes on and on. Im sure this will fix peoples economic issues as well as prayers fixing a cold. But its SK you can tell someone an angel gave you a rock and it can cure covid and theyll believe you. But its clearly the carbon tax thats the issue. Not the 40k a year salary and the $60k pickup truck payments thats the issue. Cause Lord knows loud pipes save lives yall. Is there a provincial election coming up there ? Because voters can be pretty stupid. My family gets back slightly more in rebates than they pay. Moe is gonna regret this So we can just ignore laws now? Good to know the next time Im in SK I shouldve probably realised the drunk driving, vehicular manslaughter premier was pro ignoring laws Are they going to use that money to clean up the abandoned oil wells scattered around the province? I really hope other provinces do the same and western Canada should form its own country. Ottawa has gone bonkers. Every $50/month from everyone for Carbon Scam Tax.'

Upgrade your shitting wiring you cheapskate landlords! More than 600 people died in BC in the 2021 heat wave. Any landlord not permitting (or providing - it‚Äôs obscene we don‚Äôt have maximum heat levels in apartments) should be charged with murder if their tenant dies from heat. Are apartments required by law to have heating? If so, why arent they required by law to have cooling? Issues with electrical safety and circuit capacity should be handled by the electrical code and enforced by the province and regulators. The cost of maintaining safe wiring should be borne by landlords and homeowners. So if there is a legitimate safety issue here, either the province isn‚Äôt regulating or owners aren‚Äôt complying. Or maybe it‚Äôs both. Either way, to me it‚Äôs unacceptable to tell tenants they can‚Äôt connect CE/UL marked consumer appliances to circuits that are supposed to be able to handle the load. If they landlord knows they have unsafe wiring in their buildings, get it fixed, yesterday. Tenants should not bear this cost directly. That‚Äôs insane.', 'One time I was living in this shitty apartment that had no AC, it was unlivable conditions. We went and got a cheap AC unit to put into the window. The landlord sent us a letter a few days later saying we can‚Äôt have it in the window because it looks trashy. Like bitch I‚Äôll show you trashy. The whole place was a mess to begin with. We moved there because they had a pool on site. But when it came time to use the pool they didn‚Äôt want to up keep it so you know what they did? Filled it in with dirt and put a few flowers there. No pool and no AC? It was some bullshit Governments want us at half electric cars within a decade, and our buildings cant even handle the extra electricity from AC units, much less charging a car. We need the government to invest in grid and service upgrades for a future of more electrical demand It should be the landlords responsibility to make sure the units they rent are livable. If the building cannot support air conditioning then they should be updating the windows or insulation instead. If their tenants die due to heat, they should be held liable. For what renters pay, they should be able to live comfortably and not suffer for months. If its not specified as a term in the rental contract, theres nothing a landlord can do to stop a renter from installing one; its not a permanent modification. If landlords are putting this kind of thing in rental contracts, the government should step in and make it something which cant be barred. All of these buildings were built with demand factors rolled into the service calculations. They were also built to allow for incandescent and flourescent bulbs. We use less enough energy on lighting to allow for an air conditioner. Most of the landlord concerns are just people being cheap. Fuck them, run the AC!!! Remember 40 degrees indoors is heatstroke temperature. And a lot of us experienced that in BC summers. Fuck these landlords who don‚Äôt consider themselves slumlords as they charge thousands of dollars a month for literally fatal apartments and then have the audacity for blaming tenants for taking steps to make the property livable.', ' Dying Nanaimo woman evicted without cause, left without heat and power  Kalyuga This post is unlocked again after cleaning it up. **Anyone asking for the landlords name will be banned for 30 days.

Topic 9: ' If the hot weather keeps up, Ontario is ‚Äòat risk‚Äô of power shortages this summer, report finds  Next promise: buck a day air conditioning lol Quick douggie! Pull more wind turbines out of the ground!   Just happened in my area last week! Welcome to Texas North! But I thought tax cuts would solve this problem?? Weve been backing off building new generating capacity for ages. Yes we need to increase the green fleet but the kind of peaking issue that roaring hot days presents is very hard to manage. Typically hydro and gas turbine plants are the ones that are responsive enough to pick up a peak event. That said weve avoided building any really significant generating capacity, the Province hasnt followed through and has until June 30th to submit final appeals for an operating license extension at Pickering, but thats only until 2026. Darlington Unit 1 & 3 are in refurbishment outage, scheduled 30 months, though Unit 2 took longer. Bruce is extended to 2028, possibly further but who knows. We have a 5-ish year horizon to fill in some serious baseline generating capacity. Gonna be a fun time. Good maybe the politicians will finally stop kicking the can down to the next premiere. I dont have high hopes since we have had failure for 40 plus years. Look at the mess the libs and cons have done.   We need to invest in power generating stations, mainly nuclear and renewable, along with upgrading our distribution infrastructure. Heres a thought, bring back feed-in-tariff and have solar generating capacity at the same time you have massive air conditioning demand. Lol and they federal government want more people buying EVs? Maybe increase power supply first? Gotta keep that fear dial pegged to 10üòÇ', ' If the hot weather keeps up, Ontario is ‚Äòat risk‚Äô of power shortages this summer, report finds  If only there were a technology that worked well in the sun to produce electricity Maybe now is not the best time to bring up the fact that the blackout happened exactly 20 years ago. We could be celebrating this anniversary in a major way this year with rolling blackouts. OPG is actively trying to convince the government to refurb the Pickering nuclear plant like theyre doing at Bruce Power and Darlington. No luck so far. But its worth noting that Pickering at this time is still in operation. Damn yo guess Id better start looking for my power bank then This essentially confirms the grid is not ready for the electrification of everything. We need massive new base load capability. And I say this as a proponent of the electrification of everything. Lets make sure new builds need less electricity and help retrofit existing buildings? Cheapest electricity is the one we dont need. Ford cant even keep the lights on, why do people put up with him? Guess cancelling those solar contracts was a bad idea, as was tying up a lot of new wind and solar projects to focus only on gas. More nuclear now! Power shortages? How about you take the massive delivery charge on my hydro bill and fuck right off with that shit. By all means, lets continue to allow giant corporations to force workers to come into their offices which are sucking up juice for air conditioning and lighting, when remote work was working just fine, all so they dont lose property value. Ridiculous. They said the same thing last summer.... Something tells me Ford is going to use this as an excuse to build gas power plants Good thing DoFo cancelled all those green energy windmills. elect a con government expect power shortages Im not surprised. I bet the private companies havent been upgrading equipment', ' If the hot weather keeps up, Ontario is ‚Äòat risk‚Äô of power shortages this summer, report finds  Good thing were taking Pickering offline [removed] In the same way that they are doing at Bruce Power and Darlington, OPG is actively attempting to persuade the government to refurbish the Pickering nuclear plant. So far, no luck. But its important to remember that Pickering is still running right now. Ok so am I missing something here. If we cant run AC during heat waves without risking running out of power how do we expect to make this huge switch to electric cars cities keep talking about? If air con itself is that much of a problem then adding massive amounts of charging stations In cities, on highways and in houses isnt going to help. We need to overhall our energy system fast before an electric car boom takes off. Which hot weather has to keep up. We literally had just 4 or 5 days where it crossed 25 degrees. The forecast for next 10 days revolves around 20. Power shortages are a given however, as demand is always growing. But apparently no long term plan to grow base capacity. We need to rapidly expand our nuclear base. There is no other option. Stupid to pretend renewables are a substitute with no storage capacity. Theyre capable of supplemental extra capacity at best, and only when their energy source is available. And they‚Äôre mandating that every new car sold after 2030 be electric???? Guess we should probably start normalizing power shortages now‚Ä¶. To anyone who says ‚Äúthe infrastructure will be finished by then‚Äù, don‚Äôt hold your breath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs taking them more than 8 years to build a pipeline. Can‚Äôt imagine how long it will take for them to re-engineer Canadas electrical grid Cool, just keep piling on the problems. Do we already have too many electric vehicles for the power grid? Good thing they‚Äôre outlawing internal combustion. Electric vehicles for the rich, back to horse and buggy for the peasants.'

Currently if you are unionized and working for the province or a crown they are doing their best to not bargain in good faith and are clearly chomping at the bit to see strikes rather than wage increases Edit: At a time when MB hydro is projecting nearly 700m profit.

It says that the union wants X% more than what they‚Äôre currently getting and of course they do. Everyone wants a raise. But what are they getting paid right now? Can anyone working in a professional role comment on morale, etc. at the City of Winnipeg? Would it make any sense to jump from one of the organizations listed in this article to the CoW?', '**Article:** A massive labour dispute is simmering this summer as nearly 17,000 employees at Manitoba liquor marts, MPI and colleges are working under an expired contract and their union has told them to prepare for a strike vote. The Manitoba Government and General Employees‚Äô Union said it‚Äôs been at the bargaining table since March and the employer won‚Äôt take into considering high inflation and the sorry state of a civil service that‚Äôs struggling to recruit and retain workers. ‚ÄúStrike is always the last resort and our goal is to bargain a deal at the table,‚Äù said Kyle Ross, president of the union that has 32,000 members. There are 11,000 provincial government employees, 1,780 at Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries, 1,716 at MPI and 2,000 MGEU members at Manitoba colleges. None of them has a collective agreement. In a bargaining update Wednesday, however, the workers were told that in order to get a new contract that helps revitalize provincial services and provides fair wage increases, the MGEU ‚Äúwill likely need to ask members to provide a strong strike mandate.‚Äù In an interview, Ross called it ‚Äúan unfortunate situation.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt means we‚Äôve not had fruitful negotiations at the table and I don‚Äôt think the employers or the government understand the environment right now with the world we‚Äôre living in,‚Äù said Ross. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in a different world, frankly. Their offers are out of the realm of reality. So it‚Äôs been a challenging time.‚Äù Currently, 27 per cent of positions in the Manitoba public service are vacant after years of wage freezes and civil service cuts. It‚Äôs a struggle to fill them and maintain services, according to ‚ÄúState of the Civil Service 2023 ‚Äî Cuts and privatization catching up with Manitoba‚Äôs public services.‚Äù The MGEU report was unveiled Wednesday at the same time as its new slogan ‚ÄúCatch up, keep up.‚Äù The union is looking for a contract similar to that of their federal counterparts that takes into account the rising cost of living and high inflation. The Public Service Alliance of Canada announced Friday that members who were on strike for 12 days in April have ratified a contract that includes a 12.6 per cent pay increase over four years and closes the gap with inflation. ‚ÄúLast year alone, inflation was 7.8 per cent in Manitoba,‚Äù said Ross. ‚ÄúWe have yet to see more than eight per cent offered over four years to our members,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFood has gone up, fuel has gone up, housing has gone up. Our members are really feeling the pinch. They‚Äôre doing more with less. There‚Äôs less of them to do the job. It‚Äôs been really challenging,‚Äù Ross said. Because unionized workers‚Äô wages are set by collective agreements that last several years, they‚Äôve been hit harder by inflation than non-unionized workers, who have benefited from higher wage growth due to tight labour markets, said University of Manitoba economics Prof. Jesse Hajer. Seeking a contract with pay bumps on par with their PSAC counterparts seems fair, said Hajer. ‚ÄúIt is reasonable that unions like MGEU are asking for increases to make up for these losses.‚Äù Under the Progressive Conservative government, public sector workers have seen their purchasing power fall due to wage freeze legislation that while not enacted, set the bargaining mandate across government, and later high inflation, he said. ‚ÄúThe result has been falling real (inflation-adjusted) wages, uncompetitive salaries, and a deterioration of the public service in terms of a smaller civil service and very high vacancy rates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince 2017, core civil service workers saw wages increase by 10 per cent, but over this period the cost of living increased by 22 per cent,‚Äù Hajer said. ‚ÄúThis means that workers have seen the purchasing power of their wage fall by 12 per cent since 2017. The situation is even worse for MGEU workers at MPI, MLCC and in the college sector, where wage losses have been in the 16 to 20 per cent range.‚Äù In a statement, a spokesperson for Government Services Minister James Teitsma said the size of Manitoba‚Äôs core government has decreased since 2016 mainly because of ‚Äúa natural attrition, fluctuations in seasonal staffing and the movement of approximately 900 employees from Manitoba‚Äôs public service to Shared Health last year.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur government is implementing recruitment strategies to address employment needs, focusing on key changes to advance innovation and the modernization of Manitoba‚Äôs public service,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúThese changes are aimed at better outcomes for Manitobans as well as better value-for-money for taxpayers,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúSome organizational adjustments have been required, and efforts have been made to redeploy affected employees to other priority areas where possible. We are also filling priority vacancies to support continued direct service delivery, a data-driven workforce, succession planning and targeted outreach.‚Äù carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca **END**.', ' Education minister faces heat at election debate  Yeah, its not suspicious at all that the PC govt - whose current leader seconded Bill 64 before later turfing - claims to have spent forever working hard on a great new funding model for Education, which, coincidentally, they wont be ready to release until after the election. Good. Keep the heat on. What does the article say? Vote him OUT!! While I appreciate and agree with MacIntyres comments that every kid needs to be reading by the end of grade 2, the problem and the solution are a tad more nebulous. My mother was an ECE much earlier on in her career and focused on reading recovery. After she retired, she tutored a kid in grade 6 would couldnt read. He was simply guessing at the words in front of him, and they werent particularly good guesses. Was painful to witness. Untreated ADHD didnt help, but his home life was pretty toxic as well. Hes in high school now, and doing much better, but still needs help here and there. The school and division did not have the resources available to help. Leaving the problem this long is just setting up kids for failure. School just becomes a daycare if kids are unable to learn because they cant read or write effectively. The problem isnt even that hard to solve. It just takes, surprise surprise, resources. People dont seem to temper the fact we have the second highest per capita spending on education with the realization that we also have the highest rate of child poverty of any province in Canada, and its basically been this way for decades. Just as education outcomes and crime are intrinsically linked, so are education outcomes and poverty. We need more teachers, smaller class sizes, more specialists to help those who need it, but also stronger social programs that pull people out of poverty, and spending money on breakfast and lunch programs so kids that are already significantly disadvantaged dont also have to contend with learning while hungry. The list goes on and on... But it sure beats the PCs current plan to just pull on our bootstraps a bit harder.'

Topic 10: 'It‚Äôs been about 6 years since I‚Äôve turned on anything other than the infloor heating in my bathroom. The last time I actually needed heat was when it was colder than -10 for over a week. Edit: face southwest on 5th floor of a downtown low rise. I relented and turned the thermostat on this week already because the prayer plant stopped praying and the cat started sniffling lol. Its just when its hovering around zero that it starts to get a bit chilly in here. The biggest factors would be the windows (double pane and/or size as in floor to ceiling) and what side you are facing. When I lived facing south I hardly ever turned my heat on in the winter as on sunny days it would heat the entire condo for a long time. Also, depending on what the temperature is set in the common areas on your floor you will get some heating as well with air being forced under your door. Then consider what type of flooring you have an underlay then there will be some insulating properties or conduction from suites above and below. Moreover, hardwood flooring and especially tile will be colder say versus carpeting. Your sensitivity to cold is another factor. My girl friend needs the place toasty and has to have the heat turned up. Never. South facing and my apartment holds heat like a mofo. We still have one of our air conditioners out, although it‚Äôs getting very little use these days. We turned it on briefly when it dropped below -5, but other than that‚Ä¶ never. I found it depended on concrete vs. woodframe. I used to be in a concrete building on the 25th floor and didnt have to turn on my heat for the entire 3 years I lived there. Recently moved into a new wood frame and turned on the heat a couple weeks ago. Heating now is radiant in-floor so it was more for warming the toes in the morning than the actual house being cold. I got a lot of windows so my place can heat up if it‚Äôs sunny. These days I‚Äôm still running air con till about 4 pm then it switch to heat for the evening', '19th floor north facing - never and still stuffy 9th floor west facing forest - only on some cold days 2nd floor west facing - feet are constantly cold but heat is too expensive. Use slippers and little area heaters for 20 min intervals. We have to turn the pilot light off in the fireplace because it heats the place up too much. Have never turned on the actual heat When I was in a condo, I never had to turn my heat on. The heat from other units was enough to keep my unit at a comfortable temperature. I lived in a wood frame low rise building though and was surrounded on every side by another unit. Sw facing condo with a lot of windows midway up a highrise Turned from air con to heat the week of remembrance day. But I keep the temp the same 22. Turned it on way earlier last year when we got snow in the first week of Nov. Some years we don‚Äôt turn it on at all, sometimes we turn it on for the coldest couple of weeks. Usually when the temperature is consistently around 0 or in the negative for a few days which doesn‚Äôt always happen! I started turning on the heater 2 weeks ago. Condos dont need as much heat. You can save a lot on heating/bchydro by using the breaker instead of the thermostat to control the heater. I have the heat set at the temperature I like, but never has to come on thanks to my neighbors as its always a few degrees higher in the living room. 26th floor NE-facing condo - havent turned it on yet either! It hasnt gone below 21 in my living room yet, and this is with the fact that my bedroom waffles between 14 and 17 leaving the window open 24/7 because I sleep best when my bedroom is cold af. I leave my bedroom door closed at all times but given its an interior door, Im still pretty impressed with how much it hasnt also cooled down my living room.', 'Mine is easily able to keep my room toasty. I live in a small condo with triple glazed windows. New building, heat pump, couldn‚Äôt get over 20 until the sun shone through the windows 1970s era apartment building, I think the windows are single pane. The heating is working OK, but the chill can be felt in the floor, even higher up. My small space heater has been working overtime since last night. One bed on the ground floor in a 1960s building. Baseboard keeps the bedroom warm enough, but the main room is only 18¬∞ with the thermostat at 23¬∞. I have a space heater that I bring out one week a year Just checked the. Mysa, been trying to heat a room up to 20 all day still at 19. New wood frame condo here  yeah, just have the discussion with my Strata. because the hot water baseboard heater poorly blaze warm air. Unfortunately no fire place, only a heat blanked. I have around 14 degrees in my apartment and hope, that a plumber will show up today. Radiant floor heating and I had to turn the thermostat up to 27 to get it warm enough but now it‚Äôs working great. Mine have been fine. Set to 23 and it‚Äôs at 23. My building does have brand new windows so maybe that helps We have a condo from the 80‚Äôs with baseboard heat only. (1000 sqft) All winter used to be hard to keep warm. Baseboard heaters would run all the time but still parts of the condo were chilly and if you turned down the thermostat it got chilly real fast. However a couple of years ago we had the entire building rain-screened with new insulation in the walls and brand new triple glaze windows. The first winter after the rain screen our Hydro bill dropped over 50% and it‚Äôs been that way ever since. During this cold snap it‚Äôs easy to keep the place warm, thermostat at 20, baseboard heaters kick on occasionally and the temperature inside is comfortable and stable. So for people with baseboard heaters it‚Äôs going to entirely come down to how well your unit is insulated and the type of windows you have installed.'

The winters make us insane and cloud our judgement. You‚Äôll never find people willingly spending time in this weather during peak sun in parts of the world where it‚Äôs the norm like Southeast Asia. I honestly prefer -30 to this. Im loving it. I will not love my hydro bill. Disclaimer: I am a basement cave troll who does not go outside. I love it! I‚Äôd rather have this everyday then a single day of snow and -30. Id take Winnipeg winter over this weather any day Its not really that hot. What are you all rambling about? Its like 30 degrees. Nothing a few sliced fruits and iced tea cant help with. Not unless Im sitting by a pool or on a beach. I‚Äôve had a migraine all weekend. I wish the heat and humidity would just go away.', ' Does anyone actually like this heat? Why?  I love it because it usually gives good Thunderstorms! Nah, without central AC its a bit of a pain. I like mild spring and fall weather the most. I enjoy it for the feeling of coming home to AC and a cold drink. I also like deep winter for the opposite reasons. The heat plus humidity earn a bunch of thumbs down !gif I don‚Äôt mind it, long as I can take breaks and go inside and cool off and drink water every couple of hours. My house is a tad warmer than it should be at night but that‚Äôs what a fan is for. Im fine with a few days of this weather in summer, but not two weeks straight in late May/early June. Many people seem to think that if you hate extreme cold temperatures, youre legally obligated to like extreme hot temperatures, and vice versa. I dont want to starve to death. But that doesnt mean I want to eat so much food that I choke to death either. Love it. Dont have to scrape the car, plug in the car. If unprepared in an accident I think there will be way bigger problems in -30 than +30. Driving is fun and easy again. Dont have to bundle up in winter boots and clothing, can just walk outside and go. The air doesnt hurt my face. Watermelon, cherries and corn on the cob are back in season. Bbqing, beach days, camping, road trips, travel etc. Birds chirping, everything is green again. Thunderstorms are yummy. Hammocking! I wouldn‚Äôt mind it so much without the humidity‚Ä¶ it just drains the soul out of your body lmao. Also not a whole week of it. Brutal. I hate it. We can never have a happy medium. We just go from one extreme to the next. Lol Hate it. I have POTS so I‚Äôm always hot in normal weather. This is beyond able to go outside now‚Ä¶ Also I feel incredibly bad for the ones (especially downtown) who don‚Äôt have a home with AC! Or a home at all. I want to bring some coolers of cold water down there soon! Hate this weather. It makes my allergies to pollen that much worse. Get more hives and migraines.', 'As long as I‚Äôm near a body of water or pool I greatly enjoy it. However, being 10 months pregnant right now it makes me a little uncomfortable. I love it!! It‚Äôs like 4 months of real summer, I‚Äôm in. Yes I love it! I enjoy feeling like I‚Äôm in the tropics. It does make it difficult to do any activity outside but if I‚Äôm just sitting in the sun, I love it. I love it. Way better than that bum ass -30 with vicious windchill weather we get pummelled by every year. I find it much easier to stay cooler out in the sweltering heat than staying hot in the freezing cold. Water with a fuck ton of ice in a large water jug and I‚Äôm set. Im working out in the heat fixing and installing ac its the best! I was born in an amazonian city, it feels like home. Same as winter, one has to take precautions to stay safe and healthy: proper clothing, proper ventilation. But today I was four hours on open air for Pride and did not fear for my life - in deep winter, I would never dare. I love it! Our winters are awful. Ya love it &#x200B;  Yup Freaking love it. Makes me laugh when people here complain about humidity (although today Im even like .. aah its humid) I lived in NYC for 3 years and this is NOTHING. Its basically never actually humid here, lol. I like this weather for me but I hate it for my husky mix. Can‚Äôt even take her for a walk first thing in the morning, it‚Äôs too hot for her. Yes. No skeeters, no wasps! yes It‚Äôs not even hot it‚Äôs perfect üòç I love burning fossil fuels so I guess I love the consequent heat. Yes, t-shirt and shorts iand no jacket s good. Cant really wear those often between mid September til early May (give or take) I love it. My toddler burns energy outside in half the time, so he‚Äôs having longer naps and therefore we‚Äôre getting longer breaks. It‚Äôs easy to dress for it, easy to drive, it makes swimming pools and iced drinks so much more satisfying. Our whole family is enjoying life so much more lately.'

Topic 7: 'I know you mentioned cool damp towels already, but I cant tell how far youre going with it. If you put a wet towel in the freezer for 5 - 10 minutes (taking it out while its still flexible) itll have a great cooling effect for the cats. It was perfect when I would see that my cat had melted on the floor somewhere. My place gets way too hot as I live in a condo with no air conditioning. She would get a freezer towel and move around like a regular cat again after a little bit, with the towel still draped on her. I hope your cats feel cooler today. Another scorcher is upon us! ü•µ üêà ü•∂ If you have a long haired pet, get a soft brush that they love and brush then out more, also try wetting the brush with cool water. Or if they can tolerate it, a haircut before the summer kicks in. We had both a short haired and a long haired cat. Just picking up or holding the brush caused them both come running. (We laughed and called it the magic wand) Our long haired cat also didnt mind the haircut. (IMO, I thought she looked goofy) Less hairballs is a nice bonus. buy an a/c Have you frozen shirts and then wrapped it around their necks? Put containers of ice in front of the fan. You may want to invest in a used AC check Facebook market place I straight up put my cat in the freezer üòÇ For 5 min at a time with it cracked open. No lie, I think it works beautifully -external window/skylight covers would be ideal (interior covers allow a fair bit of heat to intrude into your home), second best would be to foil line your windows (which, if youre renting, might end up causing glass damage from cracking) -a fans essential imo, as is cool drinking water always on hand (cats favour fountains for a water source, they interpret running water as cleaner/safer, so, you might encourage them to drink more by investing in a powered fountain, even a small battery powered one) -floor temps cooler than mid-height or near the ceiling (encourage your cats to stick to floor level)', 'I make sure mine have extra water bowls near anywhere they hang out. Sometimes I add a couple cubes of ice, but you dont want to make it cold-cold, just cooler. They like laying on slatted decking or mesh chairs when they are hot too, gets some airflow under them. Mine like it when you put an ice cube in your hand and pet them with it. They don‚Äôt like being wet, but somehow it doesn‚Äôt register when it‚Äôs ice melting onto them. I also put ice cubes in their water bowl. One of my cats loves the water out of the tuna can, so I made him a popsicle with it during the heat dome. He loved it! Would do again, but with something easier to get in larger quantity Too late for today, but for future reference, I fill a big plastic mixing bowl about halfway with water and freeze it overnight. Then set it in front of a fan and let the air blow over it. Instant "air conditioner." It wont cool your whole house down, but it will create a nice cool zone in front of the fan that your pets can get into for relief. Cats actually prefer warmer temperatures, but around 30 degrees. Presumably the inside of your flat will be warmer than that. You can put damp towels in the fridge for them to lie on. Our cat (13 years old) was adopted from the street in AZ and he loves the Sun and heat. He stayed on the deck the whole day yeserday and wont even want to come inside. We just added more water to his wet food and leave him there, and he is perfectly happy and fine. What I have been doing for our Burmese mountain dog puppy is gently misting him with a misting bottle and using a couple USB fans pointed at him. Also, I have been doing that on myself to keep me cool This is my first summer with a heat pump but prior to getting the install I would take frozen water bottles and ice packs and lay them against my big hairy dog. You can get the cooling bandanas for pets. I would also freeze those before putting them on my dog', 'Any day I dont have to pay for heat is a good day! Its mid April in a unseasonably heat wave..by Monday you will be cold again. Cats are naturally accustomed to heat. That‚Äôs why they always want to lay on your electronics etc. I promise they‚Äôre okay. I‚Äôve just kept a window open. Did you try opening the window? Most condos have central air no? Older units you can install portable or window ac. Im not finding it hot at all with a window and balcony open. The condo sent out a memo saying the changeover wont be till early May because the temps will dip again. Im sure a lot of people wr complaining but I find it pleasant. Dont forget Legionnaires disease, folks. Becoming rarer but air conditioning is the main cause, As the heat will be on for quite some time yet and cats have trouble dissipating internal heat the humane thing to do is shave your cats fur off. Open the windows and run the fan on the heat pump. This isnt rocket science. Cats survive all over the world in much harsher environments. I bought fans and a pet cooling matt off of Amazon. I‚Äôve also covered all my windows. It‚Äôs still spicey tho Not until next month We can turn on cold or hot air or nothing. Suggestion for keeping your cats cool: invest in a pet cooling mat. Humidity is a bit low right now so you can get some benefit from a "swamp" cooler. Hang a cold wet towel, or ideally a bunch of them. Point a fan at them in whatever way looks like it will dry them fastest. As water evaporates, it pulls heat from the air, cooling it. Were lucky we have lots of windows and a balcony door we can keep open Weather will get closer to seasonal tomorrow. Youre kitties will be happy Keeping my doors and windows open alllll day, keeping the heat in my unit off. It‚Äôs been ok so far. Dog isn‚Äôt allowed in the bed tho, he‚Äôs basically a mini space heater. Blinds closed, fans on, and lots of water.'

Topic 6: 'Two tips: &#x200B; White-backed blackout curtains. They reflect a lot of that energy back outside. Example &#x200B; Partially or Fully close vents in cooler parts of the home so more cool air ends up in the warm bedroom. &#x200B; We have a south facing 2nd floor bedroom and these two adjustments have resulted in the room staying about 5C cooler during the summer months. Look for 100% blackout curtains, they‚Äôll keep the light and heat out, and assuming you don‚Äôt have a central ac unit, a portable window unit would help. Can you grow hops on the side of the house? They absorb a ton of heat and create shade My dad built some outdoor mounted sun shades a couple decades ago. Just a window sized rectangular wood box built out of 1‚Äùx8‚Äù boards with several more attached at an angle inside the box. Deflects the sun while still allowing for seeing out. Paint it white and attach anchored hardware mounting screws to the outside window frames. Hook the shade boxes onto the screws. He attached them in May and took them down in September. Reduced the AC bill by 40%. Plants. Put some climbing beans, or a more permanent grape or a wisteria on the outside wall. Once heat is touching the building its going to penetrate, a layer of leaves a few inches off the building drastically reduces heat conduction. Its a problem with modern **CHEAP** houses. You probably have "builder grade" windows, which just means "these are the lowest grade of window that legally fit the description and will pass inspection. Thats all." Proper low-E and argon filled windows will solve your heat problem. Barring a 5000$+/window renovation, you can try cellular blinds with foil cells. Those cut the heat but are probably going to cause your windows to fail prematurely but since theyre garbage anyhow, who cares? I have cellular blinds and the effect is noticeable. The only annoying thing is that no matter how careful you are, the stupid bar will eventually develop a tilt.   Running the furnace fan should help moderate the temperature a bit as long as the rest of the house is cooler than the room in question. 100% blackout curtain, and AC does wonders. You can also put on tinted window film.', 'I think it depends on a lot of things. How many stories is your town house. I find in my 2 level house the top level gets extremely hot. That is where the bedrooms are, so we cant sleep up there without AC. A lot of townhouses are 2 stories I imagine the top level gets really hot. Also a Townhouse has at least one shared wall usually. What if your neighbors like heat and do nothing to mitigate heat. If you can afford a permanent unit outside I think it would help with resale. Also look into heat pumps. My current house does get hot on the really hot days, but weve managed to stay comfortable by keeping curtains closed on sunny windows, and honestly a well placed ceiling fan goes a long way. My previous house was poorly insulated and it was a sauna upstairs, we required a window AC unit which worked wonders, we would just have it running a couple hours before bed and it cooled down the bedroom enough. You can also keep your furnace fan running during the Summer to circulate the air. Get AC, if for nothing else than when its smokey. I didnt grow up with AC here, I dont know anyone who did, but in this changing climate its becoming more necessary. I have some family who refuse to get AC and sweat it out with fans, so Im not sure long term calgarians are always the best to ask. Your heat out east is at a whole other level where A/C is basically a necessity. Id say it really depends how hot a sleeper you are. I sleep very hot, and during the hottest days here I cant sleep. During the day Id say the heat during those hot days is fairly manageable but obviously made much more comfortable with AC. We got central AC after the heat doam of 2021 when the wife didnt allow me to open the windows because of the fire smoke. Last 2 summers it was nice in the house most definitely worth the cost. We use Auction Furnace but any reputable HVAC company would be fine.', ' How hot does the summer get Toronto Transplant here and first time home owner. I mostly lived in basements until now and usually are fairly colder in summer but now I am in a 1300 sqft townhouse and want to know if I will need a AC unit here. Prepping for summer in advance so I can get better pricing if I have to go that router. If AC unit is absolutely needed, would portable or window unit cut it or I should bite the bullet and go for central cooling unit. Please suggest any good local shops for get a from as well. Thanks in Advance I find lots of people on Reddit just say AC isnt necessary for the short period of time we have our highest temperatures, but AC has been the best addition to our house weve done. So my vote is if you can afford it, youll love it. I didn‚Äôt need AC until the constant wildfires prevented me from opening the windows at night. It really comes down to what direction your house faces. All my windows face south, and my bedroom on the second floor also faces south. It can be 18C outside and 27 in my bedroom. I lived in this house for one summer with no AC, and it was ridiculously hot more often than not. Opened windows at night and closed blinds during the day it didnt matter. Personally, I went with central air, but really, just the bedroom is what I cared about. Wife is a lifelong Calgarian who said you dont need ac here. After this place, she is a convert. We used Action furnace, I dont have any complaints. When it‚Äôs smoky (and it will get smoky) you will want your windows shut - and boy does that make it get hot and uncomfortable inside. Get an AC unit from Costco - great return policy if you don‚Äôt need it. Don‚Äôt wait until the heat wave because they all disappear. For us, it came down to the constant smoke from forest fires. Native Albertan and never needed AC growing up but with the smoke throughout the summer we cant open the windows at night to cool the house; especially with young children in the house so we opted to get AC.'

Topic 8: 'I grew up in the Caribbean and wore hoodies over my school uniform in my last 3 years of high school. Even today, many years later, I wear hoodies in the sun (if not a hoodie, a long sleeve shirt) and for some reason, I feel less warm. The sun isn‚Äôt bashing on my skin so it‚Äôs cooler to me. I‚Äôm also one of those people who wears shorts and flip flops in winter, even in the snow. As once it‚Äôs above 5 degrees, I‚Äôm good. For me it‚Äôs two things, one is just being so skinny and cold all the time, and the other is insecurity about looking so damn skinny in shorts and t shirt Be prepared for the worst, I guess? My son wears jeans and a sweater 98% of the year: rain (no jacket), snow (no toque), and sun. He isnt fond of how his legs look right now, and feels more comfortable in longer sleeves and pants. Hes willing to accept discomfort from the weather to be more comfortable with himself. So...Ive stopped nagging/judging. Except when we went up north and it was -30. I made him wear a jacket then. Otherwise, eh. I find Vancouver sun very intense and wear a UV protection hoodie zipped to neck. It‚Äôs light and actually gives a cooling effect. If only I could find something alike to cover my face, I‚Äôd do so. Overall, I find myself always being covered either because of rain or sun. Don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôd ever have a chance to wear those pretty open shoulders summer dresses. The downside of having sunburn makes it not worth it. I wear long pants and a shirt in this weather because I protect my body parts from the sun üòÑalso 29 is not 35. It‚Äôs warm, but not crazy hot imho Was just in Seattle and everyone was bundled up like crazy, it was mega hot', ' For the people that walked around in long pants and hoodies, in this heat. How are ya able? It was 29¬∞ out and this bloke is walking around on the beach with a hoodie and long pants on. Not only him. Others too. Shocked. Teenager on the bus, with no A.C. Sitting there in a black hoodie with denim baggy jeans and boots! Id be dead if I had a hoodie on in this heat. body dysmorphia Ive seen people in Hong Kong in full suits in hotter and more humid weather. I would have melted going out the door. Ive seen girls in mini skirts in the middle of winter when I have 5 layers on. To each their own. Man‚Äôs not hot. Lots of people stay wearing longsleeves and trousers for sun protection (even if they choose the wrong materials for heat safety), and lots of others are insecure about parts of their body - summer is hell for people with like skin problems/diseases or bad scars from accidents, drug recovery, or self-harm like cutting. Too many people don‚Äôt behave right when they see folks who try to be brave and wear a tshirt that exposes their personal struggles, so lots of folks wear that hoodie in 30C weather. If you‚Äôve never had to worry about stuff like that congrats! Be short sleeved and beautiful. but pls wear sunscreen, esp if you have melanin bc people be lying to dark skinned folks about ‚Äúnatural protection‚Äù and docs end up catching skin cancers on them in far far later stages than others üò¨ I always figured these people were from somewhere really hot in the world and that they just find Vancouver cold. Different people are comfortable with different things. stay cold after being in extra AC for extended periods of time I am not happy with how my body currently looks in summer clothes and prefer to cover up :/ Momma didnt raise no bitch Some people dont want to tan.....dont blame them Could be a body positive thing . I didnt start wearing t-shirts and shorts until I was comfortable in my own skin . i haven‚Äôt shaved my legs in a while that‚Äôs the only reason i‚Äôm wearing long pants rn lol', 'that was me when I was a teenager. hated showing any skin whatsoever. now IDGAF but I still prefer being warm to cold. Ill wear a hoodie when I feel like it damnit! I think younger folks have better temperature control than older peeps. I literally sweat when I see people walking in hoodies during warm weather like today +31 earlier today so I just went to the bank and hurried home as fast as (safely) possible‚Ä¶ had to defer my errands to a ‚Äúcooler‚Äù day. WTF was I thinking wearing my sweatpants outside today?!? ETA: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve administered my asthma medication so fast to date As someone who wore jeans and a hoodie today grocery shopping. I spent 98% of my day in a cold ACd office/house. Im not changing for the 20 seconds I walk between my car and the grocery store because I might look like a fool :) man‚Äôs not hot I am trade, and start working at 6.30 in the morning. I am not allowed to wear shorts on job site and I need to wear hoodie as well because it is little bit chilly early morning I wear a light UV protection hoodie from Uniqlo and light long pants (also from Uniqlo) cause I dont like burning. My mom is from the philippines. On a day like today she wears a jacket and long sleeve and slacks. She doesnt start getting hot until its like 35+ here and the humidity is up. I know right, it is hard to believe, but then I think about how I am a Tshirt in 8 degs guy and realise that people can be crazy at both ends of the spectrum I‚Äôm from tropical country. I‚Äôm self conscious about my calves üòû Ask the girls lined up outside the Granville clubs in February wearing spaghetti straps the same question. I had this problem last month. It was too cold without a hoodie when waiting for the bus early morning ü•∂. And warm the rest of the day ü•µ. It‚Äôs just who I am Coming from Saskatoon, I wear a hoodie (bunnyhug) & jeans year round. Some people don‚Äôt want their tattoos to be exposed to the sun nor to people'
