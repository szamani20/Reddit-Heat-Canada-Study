 Im Tara Carman, an investigative journalist for CBC News and for eight weeks over the summer, I led a project to see how hot it got in Canadian homes without AC or cooling. AMA! In our Urban Heat investigation, we found people living at temperatures experts consider dangerous for some people, sometimes for days or weeks at a time. There isnt much data in Canada about how hot it gets indoors. But we know indoor heat can be deadly — almost all the 619 people who died during BCs summer 2021 heat dome died inside. So we set out to collect that data, putting 50 temperature and humidity sensors in the homes of people in five cities (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Windsor and Montreal) with little or no central cooling. They took measurements every 10 minutes. We found some people got no relief at night, with temperatures peaking on average at 7 pm and taking several hours to cool down. For some, the health effects, both physical and mental, were significant. And one of our participants, an 88-year-old man in B.C., did not survive the summer. Proof: Read our full investigation here: Listen to the What on Earth podcast (Sept. 10) here:  This year I wanted to install a heat pump to get some cooling in my house. When I checked the Federal govt rebate site, it told me that because I wanted to do the work in 0-3 months (credit card in hand, lets do this!), I probably wouldnt qualify as the process takes about a year to get approved! Has there been any investigation as to why this process takes so long? If climate change really is an emergency, why is the government grant system so painfully slow? Can you speak to any mitigation strategies some of your participants might have used (cooling fans, evaporation fans, etc.) and how effective they might have been? How hot did it get in peoples homes without AC or cooling? I am sorry. What was the purpose of this investigation? Is there something in the building code that needs to be changed? Why does this obvious fact require an investigative report?

 Heat pump companies A few months ago I had scheduled some companies to come by my home to see about replacing the ducted heat pump. I managed to get responses from 4 companies to set up scheduling a time. I had to leave the area for work and told all the companies via email to contact my spouse, as I was going to be away for a bit, not one of the companies showed up at the agreed upon time or some Ella so didn’t finish scheduling their appointment with my spouse. Are there any quality and reliable companies that would be able to give a quote for a ducted heat pump? Wilsons was the only company to perform a Manual J calculation to size properly. But they’ve also be a massive pain to work with. Slow on every front, plus some other issues. Shines was a good option, but also ghosted me after a few questions. Presidential and Sunshine were alright. Presidental’s Daikin units were cheapest by about 5-6k for the 3-3.5T units quoted Just Once We used Quinn Electric 2 years ago and they were great ! Atmosphere Climate Control Specialists were who we went with. Locally owned, super honest, and great work MacDow Mechanical   Trane Maritime HVAC Scotia HVAC Daikin Glemar Heating and Air Conditioning Ready Refrigeration Or for more options try Gord at Twenty Degrees Ltd in Dartmouth If you’re still looking, shoot me a DM. My company does heat pump work, I can give you some details.

 PSA: Be careful of your furnace heat exchanger being falsely condemned Im an HVAC tech here in Ottawa and we had a job today where we were going to replace a furnace after a very large local HVAC company red tagged it for having "holes in the heat exchanger" if a furnace has heat exchanger issues it is a carbon monoxide risk and is almost always replaced. It was very obvious as soon as I got there that no-one had even ever looked at the heat exchanger before. The ductwork was all in one piece and the burner door had very obviously never been opened. I inspected the furnace VERY closely and found nothing at all the matter with it. When I talked with other techs they said they have seen the same thing from that company before so this doesnt appear to be a one time thing. It sucks to have so little faith in the trades anymore but if your furnace gets condemned for something like this and anything seems fishy make sure to get a second opinion before you spend $5000+ on a new system without any need. Well I didnt wanna get my post taken down for witch hunting or anything but yes it was Reliance...of course My guess is the company that red tagged it was Reliance. There is a million-dollar business idea for anyone who can create a reliable trust system for contractors. Ive never repaired so much stuff around my house than the past couple of years because I just dont trust contractors anymore. And in the rare instance where I need one, I make sure to go online and understand everything I can so I at least sound intelligible and make them second guess themselves as to whether Im the mark they want to try and sucker. Companies like Reliance and Enercare are *notorious* for this shit. Theyll find any whiff of a BS reason to tag your equipment out, in order to sell you new stuff when usually a small repair job will cut it, or there was nothing wrong with it in the first place. Whats the name of this company?

 Kevin Klein faces heat at pre-election climate and environment forum  Good, he’s such a scummy fuck. Kevin Klein, our former city councilor... I still find this extremely odd that this guy was given a permit to do this, and nobody ever asked them how they planned to move the house if there was no room to move the house. Yet you cant build a deck without copious red tape.  For anyone who makes the all sides are the same argument: *During a lightning round where candidates were only permitted to flash "yes" or "no" placards, Klein stood out as the only candidate who would not support the independence of the Public Utilities Board, phase out peat mining, reinstate pesticide reduction targets, enact stricter rules to protect drinking water and create legislation to protect activists from the financial burden of responding to frivolous lawsuits* I attended, he looked like Cesar Romero in Batman, I thought he was going to reveal the true location of the bat cave during his opening. As scummy an slimy as he is, Id put him in 2nd or third for debate performance, Lamont shined, Gibson was fiery an passionate and Naylor I think came in last, she was not well prepared at all. I strongly doubt Kevin Klein has felt anything in decades. This guy is greasy AF Kevin Klein is a goof. Shame on those that voted for this slimy fuck. More reasons not to vote for him. Once again, Im surprised the Party is letting them attend these things. What did Nygard Jr do now? Is this the same Kevin Klein who says he’s Métis when he really isn’t. Oh this slim ball.

Nothing like having to force food merchants not to be greedy cunts so people can afford to simply buy basic groceries. The two cheapest big outlets , wtf. How about fucking sobeys , Westons and empire . Thats nice something is being done, and good on the feds for being actively on this. Will it see results? lets wait and see. Im not terribly optimistic, and I think more drastic measures are actually needed. ~~Also, a bit annoying I dont see a CBC piece on this. This is actual news we should be kept up to speed on. Im probably just not seeing it on first glance.~~ see Yuukikos post below for the CBC piece from Oct 5. Look American companies doing it first. This show in full transparency how Canadian oligopolies are the worst. Fuck, I hate capitalism. Now that they shrunk all the products why not?! PCs shrinkflation is starting to hit the shelves now. It’s sad. Would love to see those Shrinkflation stickers in Canada too. I want to see the conservatives argue for a free market over this What really sucks is this will only be like a summer sale. You dont generate record profits on "razor thin margins" if youre not being shady as fuck in the background. The "razor thin margins" line can only be bullshitted so much, if thats truly the case how are they generating "record profits". Probably some other way. Wouldnt surprise me if their actual profits came from markups in distribution and warehousing of their companies, probably obscured but those entities but still under their control. Probably trying to give the government a win so they can buy time to figure out a way to obscure the greed some other way. They probably wont make record profits in the next year but I bet their supply chain infrastructure will and will be separate private companies. In a few months they will add some fees in their supply chains (owned by them) and will be able to justify higher prices on what they "aggressively" marked down. Because "the cost went up" Just.... fucking fuck

 Grocer summit to ‘take the heat off’ Ottawa, not tackle food inflation: experts  Profiteering... NOT inflation. G U I L L O T I N E tabarnak quont en a besoin dune rn Liberals and conservatives cannot fix this problem without abandoning their economic ideology. This is the natural consequence of a “market knows best” mentality. Their ideology forces them to believe that if customers are being ripped off, then a fresh new upstart will enter the market and force them to compete. The reality is that the grocery oligopoly makes it impossible for new competition to challenge them, so profiteering is rife. The solution is to break these companies up into smaller ones, and pass laws to promote new competition. This approach is incompatible with liberal and conservative ideology, so the only idea they have is “ask them nicely to lower prices”. It won’t work. > Sylvain Charlebois, the director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, will also attend the meetings in Ottawa on Monday as an unpaid observer. Oh he’s being paid alright… this guy staunchly defends Big Food while trying to ‘appear’ to be on our side. stop calling it "food inflation" its not inflation, its pure greed. nothing short of imposing strict price controls and severe legal penalties will stop this price gouging. no party, not even the NDP are proposing this. capitalism is an astounding failure. Blah, blah, blah, blah. The rich politicians talking to rich corporate execs = no action. Which then makes them Trudeaus scapegoats when they do nothing. I fully expect Trudeau to just throw a tax at them that isnt nearly enough. But he forced something to happen in a way that the Cons cant grift about. They want him to do something about grocery prices, he says he is trying to let the market regulate itself.. its a great opportunity to do too little too late that I dont think the Liberals will let pass. But they will have to do something, thats in stone now. The whole inquiry was so toothless it was painful and obvious. It was really a shame, there was a perfect opportunity for accountability and transparency and it just disappeared. Exactly. Weve seen this show before. It isnt going to result in anything changing.

 Winnipeg abuzz with wasps thanks to hot, dry weather this year, bug experts say  No kidding! These little bastards are making our short patio season even shorter I feel like the wasps have been worse than mosquitoes this year I put up a couple of the "baited" yellowjacket traps in my yard last week. They have become a horror show. Easily 500 in each. Yet somehow theres still a dozen or so every time we try to sit on the patio. Allegedly were getting some early fall weather thanks to all the smoke among other factors, so they should be getting plenty of crab apples early to get drunk and belligerent off of. This article is an American one and not the Canadian one I read earlier, but it makes a lot of the same points. Wasps. Fucking bastards. Edit: Global News was the Canadian source. Thanks to u/Armand9x for posting the article. Global News article. Hot, dry, weather? Did everyone have a different July than me? Wearing sweaters during the day and night? Ive never gone thru so much propane in my trailer to keep it warm... Also using the “Rescue” traps and yes, they are “freakishly effective.” And can attest to the wasps swarming around the trap as soon as it is discovered. The nice thing about those traps is that they are geared specifically to yellow jackets so the bees are safe. And yet, there are still multitudes of wasps … Two bites so far and the last one was very painful all through the night. Never had a problem with them but lately, they have been very aggressive.   Ive found less mosquitos this year bya long shot and about the same wasp count as last year

Foreign corporations to the rescue?.... What is this reality were living in? The plot is getting a bit ridiculous now.   I can see why Canadian corporations are so desperate to keep American corporations out of the country. Why havent prices risen at Dollarama??? Hmmmmmm 🤷‍♂️ So I says, I says, anyways here’s wonderwall….. *doubt* What’s really interesting is the comment regarding grocers in Europe going after the brands for shrinkflation. I didn’t understand that the lays chips having less in the bag or the shampoo bottle being 50ml less but costing the same is the doing of the brands and manufacturers themselves. I just connected it to the grocers. So the American stores lead in price cuts yet the Canadian grocery chains are silent. Disgusting how Canadian grocery chains with RECORD PROFITS say they will hold the line but American grocery chains say price cuts. Boycotts are the only way to get there attention. BS... I just got 2L milk for 8 bucks from Walmart.. I was like wtf! only peanut butter and chips were a dollar less that loblaws and Sobeys Save on Foods and Quality Foods are both culprits. 🤷 Now let’s turn up the heat on the Bank of Canada. The two least evil groceries lol… empire and Loblaws will laugh and give us the finger. That’s why I only shop at Walmart and Costco except for emergencies. The real reason so many Canadian industries gouge us and are terrible is a lack of competition. Groceries, airlines, cell phones.. Canadians get the shaft because of a bizarre protectionism to keep people like Galen Weston in monopolies. We need competition to make these markets better. Canadian grocers are the worst Maybe Canada can stop overtaxing people to supplement its overspending. Simplest solution would be a law that no food item can be sold for more than x% above cost. Costco I believe never charges more than 15% above cost (more often less) and they aren’t exactly hurting. They’re markups pay for overhead and the membership fees are their profit. Obviously regular grocery stores couldn’t survive on that type of margin, but if it was sat 25%, it would ensure there was no bullshit pricing, or gouging. Forever. For all food items. one problem solved

Im not sure if this was mentioned but there are great rebates out there for getting off oil and switching to heat pumps. Canada greener homes/efficiencyNS should have all the info. Apologies if I missed that being mentioned! When I’m retrofitting older homes, I generally recommend ducted if it has a lot of separate zones, especially if you already have the ductwork in place it’s usually the best option for whole home heating/ cooling. You can put ductless if the layout permits it, there’s other options as well but these two are the most cost effective in my opinion. Something to keep in mind for ducted, you often need 200a panel to handle the electric heater bank which is often 60a. Usually a panel upgrade is also necessary for older homes. Also, go through Efficiency NS before you do anything, there multiple grants available for your home, as well as interest free loans up to 40k. A lot more available than just heatpumps as well. So, based on my experience, I’ve found the heat pump was very bad. Miss conceiving, and was a big money pit just because people renting the place to me, quoted me of what the daughter paid and it was actually outrageous and we didn’t really use it all that often, which was only to cool the place, but it was the downstairs of a bungalow And the first energy bill we got was so outrageous I mean I had to basically use credit to pay it and since then we barely used it and use the electric banister heaters in the winter because it was just really hit and miss and I don’t trust it at all Doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for everybody but as most people know you have to get like a electrician to do it. It’s not regulated technically so who knows but I will just be careful. I will just kind of test it and see but I have no experience in the installation. I just know how much money I paid for it in multi month, I wasn’t a fan that’s just my own opinion. There’s no denying that they’re hanging off every persons house. It seems sometimes three or four at a time I will see

 [removed] Directly incentivize foreign competition to come in and break the backs of the current Canadian retail parasites. I would support federal tax incentives to international chains to set up shop here. I think they could do it like food gst exemptions (in BC) staples are GST free, anything processed has GST. The government could set maximum markups for staples, dairy, bread, fruit, veg, meat. Then the store can continue with their current mark up on processed food. Its regulating without being too heavy handed. It does not make sense that neither the Prime Minister nor the leader of the opposition seem to understand how inflation works. [removed] Seriously, what the fuck do they expect an industry that gets a 4% net margin in a good quarter supposed to do about high prices? We know. The Liberals are treating this as a comms exercise. They were/are trying to get away with lining the pockets of their corporate and landlord friends as long as possible. Federal funding to support local food security non-profits to start co-op grocers would be something. We have a great program where we live thats run by a non profit and provides an awesome deal on fresh fruit/veggies. Anyone can participate and the more people that do, the cheaper it is with bulk discounts. And folks can donate extra to subsidize food for low income people.

 B.C. officials warn of extreme fire behaviour due to heat wave, dry winds  The British Columbia Wildfire Service says hot and dry weather is contributing to “extreme fire behaviour” in the southern Interior as a ridge of high pressure settled over the province this week, sending temperatures soaring and further drying fuel in the forests.

 Is Earths Largest Heat Transfer Really Shutting Down? Related to Canada due to the fairly rapid and dramatic effect such an event would have on our Maritimes and Quebec. And the worst part is climate scientists concluded in a recent paper it is 95% likely to collapse at some point between 2025-2095. Look forward to a potential 2-3 foot ocean surge on the east coast from messed up oceanic thermal physics. When the AMOC collapses, 70degrees to the poles, and 30degrees to the equator will become uninhabitable. Luckily industry will die so the remaining trees MIGHT be able to stave off the carbon. There will be mass migration. It will happen FAST. …stop having kids it’s not worth it. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also slowed by 40% which wasnt supposed to happen until 2050. The amount of carnage worldwide this year is waking a lot of people up to how bad things are, but theres still a gap to _really_ how fucked we are. If this year seemed bad...its only going to get worse. If that happens, were pooched all around the world. That would be like the Earths magnetic field disappearing.

 NSPower Heat Pump Financing logic - pls help me understand Recently purchased Heat pump under NS power financing for 3 years. After rebate and all I am supposed to pay 8855. It got divided into set amount of 273 payable (7% interest) for 36 months along with usual power bill. Now we paid down payment of 3k against principle i.e. 8855 . But the monthly payment after that down payment remained the same. On checking with NSpower finance team, they said the monthly payment amount will remain same just the number of payments will get reduced. I am still confused here, even with the number of payments reduced am I not paying the interest on the initial principle i.e. 8855 not pending principle which is 5855 (8855 minus 3000) ? Does anyone understand this logic or had prior experience as above? Just sounds like a smaller amortization period. Ask them to break out your principal Vs interest costs. Or, it’s a front loaded loan and the interest is baked in at the beginning so there’s nothing else to do. Thats not just NS Power, that has to do with the terms of the loan. Some loans calculate interest and apply it when the loan is issued, so your payments arent divided into principal and interest, its just a "payment". I had an auto loan that was like that, I paid it off a year early but saved no funds. Mortgage interest is calculated differently (monthly). Which means that when you pay extra principal in a given month, you will pay less interest the following month. Isnt that how most loans work? any lump sum payment goes on the principal. Your monthly payment stays the same but the term of the loan is decreased With the 3K down payment at $273/month you should have ~23 payments and pay ~$420 in interest If you had not paid the down payment, after ~36 payments you wouldve paid ~$990 in interest. If you could adjust your payment to span 3 years, youd pay ~$181 monthly, and have paid $653 in interest.

 Your rebate is going to be specific to your property and what you get installed. I believe the max amount is $5K + $600 for the energy audit. You need to get the audit done first and you need to pay for everything up front first before you get the grant money. Here’s an article  Shop around for companies who install, some of the larger ones actually offer to set up/apply for everything for you, and you just collect the cheque. I recently went through this process, including the home retrofit grant, and it was super disappointing. Heat pumps in this climate only really work if you have a new home that is super airtight/ energy efficient, otherwise you are going to have insane power bills. Throw in all the requirements of the energy grant (like there can’t be a gas backup burner for when it is too cold), and there relative small refund for the cost of the heat hump, not worth it. I live in 1970s home, looked at replacing a 20 year old furnace, and after multiple quotes, the math didn’t add up, cheaper to get a new gas furnace. Clearly the person that wrote the energy grant is someone that lives in Victoria, who has never seen winter and power is dirt cheap. I did take advantage of doing a bunch of other energy upgrades that I could use the grant for (like air tightening) but some of the other grant stuff was ridiculous. I wanted to re-insulate a wall, but the grant requires 20% of the house to be re-insulated and then it will only cover 20% of the costs for like $500. There is a bunch of other improvements you can make, but you have to spend thousands of bucks to be eligible for a few hundred dollars refund. On short, if you were going to make the repairs, and you are eligible, go for it, if not don’t go out of your way to do it.

For once, walmart hasnt been the big bad guy here, sure walmart sucks and is an evil corp taking adv of employees, but they are the only grocer who kept "sane" pricing. The gov needs to turn the screws on Galen Weston and the other chains (metro/sobeys) who are directly profiteering. I bought asparagus for a TG dinner side, 3.99 at walmart, that same product was 5.99 at loblaws, and 7.99 at metro. You mean they had the power to cut prices at any point and chose not not? Shocking. Galen Weston can get fucked. I do all my shopping at wal-mart, as i worked for loblaws and cannot stand how they treat their employees, let alone rip off their customers. Been about 4 years since i spent money at a loblaws store. Also, wal-mart profit shares with employees (not sure if everyone) but I knew a guy who was a department manager and he got it. Should have been done in collaboration with Covid relief, but now that they’ve let it run wild for the past 3 years it almost feels like too little too late? I also don’t trust our govt to hire these grocery enforcement task force people for a wage that reflects the work they’ll be doing. I didnt see this article yesterday, but I was at Walmart...and the bread I buy went up a dollar. Ffs do Metro, IGA, Loblaw, sobeys, etc. ! And I aggressively hope that the profit margin of all those will drop at least 20-40%. No food company should makes 50+% markup on items. "We made $500 million in a quarter (3mths) in PROFIT (after all costs are paid) but were not profiteering " - Galen Great. Two places that are a decent drive from my town. Savings on food wasted on gas. Walmart is already one of the only affordable food shopping options.. So... Are they confessing that theyre a cartel? Gonna be interesting to see how Pierre manages should prices drop. His entire platform is affordability and inflation. Claimed the carbon tax was the reason for high prices but if the drop with the tax in place it will be clear he was simply lying.

If the wheep is consistently wet and dripping in the ground via the oil line then I totally understand why they said no.

Unless your thermostat tells you, you can often tell because the blower unit often has a display for showing status/trouble codes. Mine has a single 7-segment display and you can cross reference the codes in the manual. As for ramping, it depends on your thermostat as well. Check your manual, I have a Honeywell T6 pro and there is a droop setting in the ISU (installer set up) section that the temperature difference can be configured. Otherwise the next best thing to do is slowly increase the set point in the smallest amount over time. In my case it would be 0.5 degrees. The other unknown element for my thermostat is it has some “smart” algorithm that makes decisions. Which is infuriating when trying to figure out what’s going on. I think the intent is to analyze past performance so it knows when it can/can’t meet the set point with/without the auxiliary heat. Another way to tell is to look at your instantaneous power usage but that’s not very easy unless you have a home energy monitor wired in. I’ve had my ducted heat pump through a few winters now. This year, after reading lots of comments on heat pumps in this group I decided to do the “set it and forget it method”. I set it to 22 day and night and go about my life. Coincidentally my power bill went down (despite the NS power increase) for the same time period over the last few winters. 2 nights ago I had a sick little kid who was begging to be less hot so I turned it down to 21 for the night. When I put it back up to 22 in the am, the heat pump ran for 90+ minutes strait to get it back up to 22. Won’t do that again. When you set it and forget it the heat pump seems to run less and is less noticeable.

And we still have agricultural and agriculture adjacent people voting conservative, but still refusing to put climate change in their policy. It boggles my mind.

 Sask. to stop collecting carbon levy for electric heat in 2024, premier says  I am all for his decision, but how do I report electric heat vs general electrical usage? Unpopular hot take, but I am happy to see the provinces step up and say no to the feds. The feds have been overreaching for too long. All provinces are not equal and all have their ways of individually operating and should as such. Edit: Wow you guys proved that pretty quickly. Great. Can’t wait to pay a lot of taxpayer money for the provincial government to lose in court again. *sarcasm* "Saskatchewan has introduced legislation designed to shield executives at SaskEnergy from fines or potential jail time should the company not remit the charge." Does anyone know what this means? How can a provincial law protect someone from federal charges? Or is this just putting in writing that they arent responsible because they were ordered not to pay the tax by the provincial government (implying the feds should go after the Sask Party instead)? Laws can be ignored? Okay teachers, we dont need to ask parents before calling kids by their preferred name! The question I have is this: When the courts determine that this refusal is contrary to the law, how will the unpaid amounts be collected? Will the provincial government be on the hook (essentially all taxpayers), or will individual consumers see invoices for the amounts not collected while this decision is before the courts? I can’t wait for gas and food prices to stay the same and for everyone who’s been misled about inflation to say “see we told you the carbon tax caused inflation!” Days without being embarassed by Scott Moe: 0. Can we make it 7 days in a row? Only time will tell. Climate issues punched a $1.3 billion hole in his budget but carbon tax bad. Why not all electricity?

 95% LOWER EMISSIONS: Swedens Shift to Heat Pumps Holds Lessons for Canada  Ultimately, we need a simple, mass education push to make people understand what they are, how they work, how theyd save money and the ease of installation. They may have grants but people dont know the benefits. Ive read articles and only half understand it myself. Getting one installed in 2 weeks! Just change the building code and be done with it. Force the builders to adopt them. Can someone ELI5 what a "heat pump" is? Ive honestly never encountered the term before Heat pumps are great for like 75% of the country, if I lived in BC, the East Coast or the GTA, I would have kne for sure Something that sucks is that BC Hydro will charge you more for going over an energy limit if you use a heat pump. So it ends up being cheaper to use a gas furnance. The Swiss heat pump shift took nearly 30 years. Should we do it? Yes. But private capital needs to be interested in doing it alongside public investment. If I recall, these pumps don’t work at -25C or below, meaning they’re worthless in places like edmonton   Im going to install a heat pump right away in Alberta. My frustration is the complete lack of transparency in this industry about everything. Ive found it nearly impossible to find pricing on hardware so how is one supposed to compare quotes or products. Thankfully I have found a couple trustworthy sources and recommends but I feel sorry for folks doing it blind.

 2023 was the hottest year in history — and Canada is warming faster than anywhere else on earth  It’s probably going to fall on deaf ears coming out on the coldest day in 50 years. Why did Trudeau do this? last years fire season was seriously scary. this isnt cool. And the coolest year of the rest of your lives. July of 2023 was absolutely disgusting. The article I see above this one is about Alberta producing record levels of oil. Were #1...? Your insurance costs will make certain parts of Canada unliveable but F Trudeau! No shit, weve already had a few days ABOVE 0c in January here.

Im surprised cooling centers were not setup and announced. My mom lives with me. She’s 76, frail and always cold. Even with it at 34 here the other day, she was wearing flannel Pajamas, winter slipper booties and her bathrobe. Sitting in the sun. Whereas I was in a tank top, shorts and bare feet and had sweat pouring off me. Mom gets dehydrated very easily and doesn’t even think to drink water. Were we to not have ac inside, she’d boil to death. Yikes, dont be old and poor.

################################################################################

Serious question for anyone who cares to answer — why isn’t the Passivehaus or Passive House more prevalent here? Maybe we can start with a tax rebate for businesses to encourage working from home before we take away air-conditionning... Ill give you my A/C when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.

################################################################################

I switched to a heat pump when my ac died in June this year. The rebate and loan system is a nightmare, Im told it could take another 5 months to get those, so I paid out by taking money from my business in June and thought Id get that back before YE but now Im stuck. The program is not set up for when people actually replace these appliances, which is when they die. If you are going to do this you need to plan it 6 months to a year in advance to jump through the hoops. Should be faster and more accessible and more flexible. We are switching from Oil heating to heat pump. Last year, we paid over $5000 in oil heating from November to April. Can anyone with a heat pump and electric furnace back up (detached home) mind sharing what they paid in monthly electricity costs last year? The only way it was worth it for me was I needed a new furnace **and** to install central A/C. Everyone should watch Technology Connectionss series on heat pumps on youtube if they havent already. Has anyone here recently installed a air source heat pump? My parents have been considering it and taking advantage of the rebates. Their current gas furnace is approximately 20years old. Im not certain how old the A/C is. Like someone else pointed out, its worth it if either of those need replacing. Not worth it at all unfortunately. It’s like an EV, you don’t ditch an already functioning vehicle for one, but if you need a new car it’s worth a look. If your furnace is newish and working fine there’s no financial reason to switch. A furnace/wood stove combo is the way to go if you can manage it. If you own a new build tho, that might be difficult.

I think people are incorrectly ascribing this to Smith agreeing with this guys bigotry when in reality shes just a fucking moron who cant even be bothered to glance at the shirt of someone shes taking a picture with pretty fancy earrings on green shirt boi. Im all for it, watching both the Provincial and Federal Conservatives pander to this small minority it leaves room for the Centrist voters to sway elections in the opposite direction now. I wouldnt be surprised if the next election the NDP get in. Its just a tshirt Freedom to express all views no matter if others find them offensive . Is that not what everyone wants? Ultimately, it doesnt matter. Look at the long list of deplorable things shes done and its had almost ZERO consequences for her. Both major conservative leaders took pictures with this clown. &#x200B; It was entirely intentional. And gay pride is okay. People, you cant have it only one way. Everyone knew she was garbage, no ones surprized. Can we focus on the big shut she does wrong please? She fucks up enough already on big ticket shit, that we don’t need to point out the nickel and dime shit. I dislike Smith as much as the next one but I think it is unreasonable for every politician to vet each person they take a picture with. If you want leaders to be accessible, they need to have trust that people arent just out there looking to fry them on every trivial issue. We can do better. The shirt is dumb, the guy is probably dumber, but seeing other people in photos with this guy means hes just doing the rounds for his Instagram. Ong its a public event its just a photo. If the shirt said gay pride nothing would of been said. I just wish people saw the Hypocrisy in her and would use their vote towards someome who wants to ban Trans youth like myself amd believes Cancer (witch my step dad has) is somthing that is your control up into the 4th stage

Mine doesn’t seem to be working properly and I am thoroughly miserable. Am now tempted to go in to the office this weekend so that I can cool down. I dont know my thermostat is on 64 in the nights.....I dont even know what that is in centigrade but thats my sweet spot summer or winters same temp. 68f or 20c for you young ones We used to keep our AC at 25 for an 1100 sq ft house and our hydro bill in the summer would be $100-$150. 22 during the day 23 at night. 20 We just turned our AC on for the first time this year today, we have it set to 21. We got extra fans running lol Mt apartment includes central air in the rent. But Ive had it at 21c. 22.5 is my zone If you own your home you should look into the Canada Greener Homes Grant. Lots of grants/loans available to improve insulation, upgrade your mechanicals, create a more liveable space for less money. That grant can be paired with programs through Efficiency Manitoba to get more money back as well. 21 here. Have a hard time sleeping if it is any hotter. I thought my hydro was high. Wow Highly variable but generally around 22 But I also dont pay for hydro at my apartment (its all rolled in) 22 I keep my A/C at about 23-24 so it doesnt go on as much and last longer. I only do this because my insulation is not the greatest. 21 but the Central AC in my apartment is broken so 27 today! Its bad! I will eventually turn the AC on. But IMO its nowhere near hot enough for that yet. For the record, I was a bit worried last night, but I went to sleep with the window wide open and a fan on. Had to get up at 2am to close the window because I was freezing! Still gets cool at night. 23.5 High efficiency furnace really made my ac work so much better

Angel Food Cake went from $3.50 to $5.00 in the space of 6 months . Fuck Superstore. We should encourage home gardening Walmart raised the price on a ton of items over the last 2 months. They were late to the game. I love how full service grocery stores with steak, fish, and deli counters argue that these services need to be subsidized by the rest of the store. You charge $7/100g of sliced meat, so you really need to add $1 to Kraft dinner? If you’re loosing money on deli drop it. Except that’s the trick, you want that expensive deli, and you pay $3.99/lb for grapes. fml Stop shopping at grocery store that are absurdly marking up their products. SaveOn, thrifty, country grocers they give impression and ambiance of locally owned and locally sourced, yeah they got like 2-4 grocery spots for locals but everything else is far from it. They will not learn their lesson unless people unilaterally decide to boycott these stores. I used to shop at Walmart a lot until they discontinued price matching. Now I go to No Frills and Freshco where I can price match, and I can save both time and money that way. So isnt this proof they are guilty of collusion and price fixing? If they can agree to lower prices, they can agree to raise them. I dont know how Costco earned this reputation they have for not increasing prices. They both increased prices on a lot of items as well as reduced portion sizes for certain lines of items in the Kirkland lines. For one specific reference, simply because I have the data at hand as its something I normally get from them, heres the cost of a tub of baby formula from them from April, May and finally last week:  LOBLAWS!!! Record profits. Time for Prison for that board and CEO

################################################################################

 Why are the police targeting this one store and not any of the other dispensaries? I thought it was triggered by a preexisting landlord/tenant dispute that forced their hand? Fuck the police That sentence is nonsense. We can all have a nice giggle at these stories, and we can listen to advocates tell us that these substances are safe and even medicinal. But there are real issues and dangers as well, and we need to take things more seriously. When I was a younger man I consumed a medium-sized handful of psilocybin mushrooms, and at first everything was going very nicely. I was experiencing thoughts and feelings that I never had before, and really connecting with my friends. Well fast-forward 3 hours and Im violently shitting my pants at a late night showing of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Hot tears streaming down my face, with a damp trouser load quickly spreading its foul fragrance. Where was Brian Patterson then? Do you think he was there to console me? Do you think he was rushing out to Walmart to buy me a fresh pair of George brand dungarees? I can assure you he was not. He was probably sitting in the back of his van, counting all of his ill-gotten mushroom money. Lets not rush too hastily into legalization without fully considering the consequences. Police are maybe acting on public complaints. There are probably multiple people out there who are dosing too much and calling the police for the belief that they may possibly be dying from a bad batch 😂 Wow reeeealllyyyyt They are not enforcing it consistently. We have 2 just on Rideau that OPS keep on ignoring. No it’s not like pot which had been recognized as a medical product and that HC approved for medical use for years before shops opened up. Surprised that selling illegal drugs from a store is bringing the heat?? Shocked I am!

This sub stretching to get anything on smith is more pathetic than smith herself I dont understand what she did wrong? What exactly is wrong with the shirt...   Nothing wrong with supporting whats literally kept the human race alive for thousands of years now. It’s disgusting how the left demands everyone must accept everyone, yet never follows through on that themselves, calls everything “fascism/racism” and whatnot not realizing the only fascism around is looking back at them in the mirror. The worlds crazy when you can say “straight pride” and it’s an issue. Nothing on the shirt puts anyone down, nothing vulgar. If it was transpride, gay pride, animal pride, climate pride etc. Not a thing would be said, likely be praised. It’s wild that saying you’re straight and happy about it instantly makes you a bigot and a piece of shit with no context. Pretty crazy ass times we live in and extreme hate "Striaght Pride" has been traced back to Nazi propaganda page... No one is surprised by this... Does she though? This will be forgotten in a week. Couple of jackasses RIDICULOUS There was an apology for Conservative candidates comment about transgender children before the election. Now the election is over who cares, the people wont remember this until next election anyways. They can always issue some stupid statements to back pedal when the election is near. Danielle "I cant read" Smith Love her love the shirt ! If you voted NDP please leave

Minimum price would probably be around $14,000 and depending on how hard the installation is could be up to 20k. There is no payback. Its just for comfort. I am Ahmad for r/heatpumps and r/DIYheatpumps and on heat pumps there is a quote survey summary sheet. You can filter by region and see prices. For a condo I think you are definitely better off trying to only do a single head unit because in the price could be $4,000 to $7,000. There are also those DIY options and some even allow you to just have them wrenched together. No refrigerant mechanic needed. Ah yes, the money suck that heat pump retrofits marketed by BcHydro are real. Theyll give you a bit of money to install one, and after $20K spent youll be able to tell everyone how efficient it is!!!

 heat pump issue we have a ducted heat pump that isnt heating the house like it normally should. the air handler is blowing like it should, just no hot air from the ducts except for the two ducts closest to the handler. anyone have any suggestions or seen this happen before? the air handler filter isnt clogged, I just checked that. Get someone in to check the gas level. When mine started doing this I needed to recharge my system because of a leak in a hose.   Coolant leak? How new is it We had a similar issue - called “presidential” and they found leaks in our hose and empty refrigerant. Just get someone to come look but know that the fix may be $500 lol >from the ducts except for the two ducts closest to the handler. If the temp at the closest ducts is >16F above the temp at the return grate.... Visually inspect your ducting....

Quebec temperature between 22-27°C most of July, had a couple of days 30-32°C, plenty of cloudy days, thunderstorms, rain. Temperature has gone down to 12-18°c at night. Starting July 31st, the temperature has been below 18°c, some nights 12°c. Only today Aug 6th is 30°c, starting tomorrow dropping to 22-25°c during daytime for next week. Ive been worried not only short growing season but what has grown and expected to grow until 1-2 week of September will not even survive in August with dropping temperature. Yes I smelled the smog one morning of wildfires when in Quebec while we had rain for couple of days and temperature was 20-22°c. It doesnt make sense. Must not be anything wrong at all after all eh!? This summer has been so chill weather wise lol. Meanwhile every time I check the news there is some heat warning. The other day there was a heat warning and it was legit borderline chilly lmao. I live on the north coast of BC and it’s been abnormally hot here! A few years back during the peak of Covid we didn’t really have a summer, it rained daily it seemed. The temps are incrementally changing. It’s not always going to be noticeable, but many times it will. It was the humidity that killed it. Ontario had so much rain that the humidity stayed above 80% for most of the month making it feel way hotter. Winnipeg is below normal, can confirm I live in Vaughan, ON. This July I only turned on the AC for two nights… literally Yeah, you’re all correct. Climate change is a myth and we all grew up with “smoke” as the weather forecast. I totally remember that in the 80’s 🙄 Let’s just clear cut Canada and take back any environmental protections because as well as know… The earth absolutely is immortal and we could set it on fire and it would be fine. No consequences to any action ever! Am I right guys!? Ive been saying that since they started talking about century record breaking heat BS ... scare tactics Do South America now. Super tame summer here in southern Ontario This graph shows one measure of weather in 10 cities. It doesnt show a complete picture.

 Victoria pizza wars heat up with these brash, gooey new restaurants  I miss walking across the street from Logans to get a slice of the 420. Now that was some great terrible pizza. It would be considered a pizza war if prices were dropping to out compete each other... And they are not If youre ever feeling useless, remember that someone was paid to write this article. PS: no fucking way were well served by our pizza choices here. Vic pizza (mostly) blows... “There’s even some places that don’t even had a crust so they can jam more cheese into the box.” Same. I, too, don’t even had a crust. I am brain dead after reading that entire article, what horse shit This city does a lot of things good Pizza is not one of them What a stupid article. Feedback for the author: I have the feeling you kinda lost your enthusiasm right after the introduction. Got the lazy fingers, eh? YDafuck would you write about food without visiting those places, mate? Brilliant researcher. I am 100% in support of the Pizza wars! vICtorIa HaS ThE wORsT piZza EveR… and drivers TL;DR: There are places that sell pizza in Victoria. Here is a list of them I pulled from the phone book. The end. Chris Campbell trying to start a pizza war. If this heats up Chris the tomato sauce will be on your hands… The article would actually be better if ChatGPT wrote it about Victoria Australia and they still published it. Has anyone been to Serena’s yet? Secon Slice gets a mention but not Willows Pizza? Nothing new listed. Its not a war, standard has no true competition Anyone try Serenas pizza yet? pour one out for Zombies. Seal Point Pizza is a new one in Fairfield (in the old Hive location) Arguably best in town. And with all the pizza places it’s difficult to find a good vegan pizza. It would be nice to have options especially with all the great vegan meat and cheese substitutes, you think it would be easy. No one wants my money. Virtuous pie is ok but not great. I’ll keep making my own. Please please please. No pizza here is good. F ur biased reviews

Well, let’s see what happens. We will know soon enough, so no point in being cynical - unless of course you want to ensure negative views towards the current government. Thats a cynical way to approach the subject. Lets report on the facts. The heat deserves to be on the companies for price gouging. One has to look at what’s going on in the supply chain behind the grocery stores as well. Meat packers are taking a large percentage of the increase of beef prices with farmers and grocers getting very little.. I’ve read in places that the major chains control quite a bit of the supply chain of shelf goods, with anti compete conditions etc. Looking at one aspect will not make any impact. Personally the Grocery Corporations had their opportunity to make things fair. They claimed it was because of inflation. They said it was because of the War in Europe. So, most of us waited patiently. I mean hell, even the Fed was like, okay we will get inflation down and then we will see. Well inflation is coming down. The war in Europe is slowly stabilizing. But we are still paying outrageous prices for basic food goods and if its a packaged item we are getting less for what we pay. The only thing I blame the government for is being naïve in not seeing it sooner, but thats most likely because the grocery corporation lobbyists were throwing up a smoke screen of bullshit numbers and promises at them. Its Sept 2023 - tomatoes that are grown local are still double the price from a year ago. Thats not inflation and thats not the war in Europe. That is a very wealthy grocery corporate making the decision to pocket a 100% increase in prices for no reason other than to pad their shares. That is not fair and its time for the Fed to take the velvet off the iron gauntlet.

 More cities offering loans to cover upfront cost of heat pumps, solar | CBC News  Provinces should give them away, manufacture them in Canada, ship them within Canada, train and then pay people to install them everyone wins. Why they’re so short sighted on these projects is beyond me. But if the city doesnt have hydro that will let you run a level 2 charger to charge an electric car in your garage, youre on the hook for the $30k to upgrade their bleeding infrastructure. Sure, this makes sense. And public transit? Yeah, dont even ask about that.

Its hot in May? Too HOT 🔥 🥵 😫 How can we make it colder? I started taking buss to work instead of driving to stop the greenhouse gas but its not working? I haven’t turned on my AC yet in Regina. Was +3 this morning so just kept the windows open. I just want to live in an underground cave.

 Heads Up Winnipeg, InfraredHeat.ca Isnt Playing Fair Hey folks, Just wanted to take a minute to alert /r/Winnipeg about a situation thats been less than ideal. Theres a company in town named InfraredHeat.ca. They claim to resell Ducoterra(This US Comapny has excellent reviews) infrared radiant heating panels, but they are taking full payments and not delivering. Many months back, we placed an order with them, paid in full and everything. Since then, its been a game of cat and mouse, with the only thing Ive caught being a bunch of excuses. When I finally got fed up and asked for a refund, they stopped responding. The sad part is, Im not the only one. If you check their Google reviews, youll see a storm of 1-star ratings and unhappy customers who are in the same boat. No products, no refunds, just silence. infraredheat.ca Google Reviews I totally understand businesses can have tough times and delays, but ghosting your customers when they ask for a refund? Thats not right. At the very least, we should get a straight answer about whats going on. Im looking into what can be done about this, and if youve also had a run-in with InfraredHeat.ca, Id suggest you do the same. If you really want to get back at them you should go to a live taping of a sitcom and in between audience laughs quietly voice your grievances and hope it gets picked up by the studio mic’s so millions of people will hear your story when the episode airs. Contact Ducoterra directly. Often times, resellers have to abide by certain rules to be able to sell products. Also, if they’re using the brand fraudulently, Ducoterra would be more than happy to know such things. If you paid by credit card you can try calling the number on the back of it and do a chargeback. Delays in getting product happens, ignoring customers when they ask for a refund shouldn’t happen, if they don’t/won’t offer one is fine, but ghosting after someone asks, not cool. Seems their corporate head office is a PO Box at the UPS Store in Tuxedo Park Shopping Centre. That doesnt inspire confidence.

 Roof snow melting. Tech or heat leak? I live on the Ellerslie road near Rutherford. There is a 4 level building in front of my house and they recently re-did their roof. I observed that their roof are clear after snowing. Usually heat leak caused patches of snow melt over the roof but I am seeing the whole roof clear. The building next to it have a thick cover of snow over their roof. Is this some de- icing tech or bad roof installation? About a 0% chance of it being a novel deicing tech. Couple things could be going on : 1. Possibly , they are not done yet, and the roof is not insulated, airflow is flowing directly to the roof from inside and melting it. 2. They *are* finished and got fleeced on the insulation. (fairly common, and would explain the complete roof thawing) 3. There is a fairly large air leak somewhere - But then I would suspect patchiness, so this likely not the cause. Even, De-icing tech wouldnt be 100% uniform, so I am suspecting 1 or 2. if you have an infrared camera you can find out. What would be the benefit of having something de-snow your roof? Seems like it would be a horrendous idea in our winters. It’s likely they don’t have insulation in their attic. Someone could be raking the snow off the roof for some reason. If the snow is melting, the water has to go somewhere. That would require moving through 50-100 feet of freezing cold gutters to a drain. When it’s -20 that might cause huge problems. That really makes deicing not likely. Having your entire roof clear likely rules out poor installation as the main cause. The cost to melt the snow would be huge and could cause other problems as the water freezes. Someone removing the snow is much more likely. While still odd, it’s the explanation that makes sense. Or They have a huge weed grow op inside of their home:  100 percent heat leak and probably a bad one lol

 Heat dome settling over Alberta triggers weather warnings, electric grid alert  Summers are so hot now it’s absurd lol The wind isn’t blowing. Wind generation is at 15% of nameplate capacity. How do they announce these electric grid alerts? I didnt hear about it, otherwise I would have cut down my usage. &#x200B; If you are going to water to save your trees, Place mulch around your trees, it doubles the water efficiency. Grass will compete with and slowly kill trees. A trees natural defense against grass is to drop their leaves, but most people rake this away. If you want to increase water efficiency you can apply Permaculture food forest landscaping, it uses less water than grass and provides shade so you can actually use your backyard. link to image album. I would appreciate it if people did not water their grass lawns. There are more important things that resource can be used on. Here’s a new tip for any EV owners: set your charging times to start after peak hours (9pm). Damn Trudeau. That rascal is at it again 😤 So glad we got AC now. After that last heat dome in 2021, I really couldnt do that again lol. I see all my neighbours with their windows open all day and night and it reminds me that we made the right choice lol. It speaks to the grid when its 30 in June and the grid potentially cant handle it.   From the article: "Some ways to save energy include: - Turn off unnecessary lights and electrical appliances -Minimize the use of air conditioning/space heaters..." So its a heat dome but they want us to not use our ACs... Wild Dani Smith: ".. As Premier, you having issues with electricity up to Stage 4 blackout is on you.."!! Not trying to derail this thread. but remember when Edmonton summers were chill? Pepperidge Farm remembers! This is all Trudeaus fault. Notley too I can remember every summer since 01, we are in for an unprecendated wildfire season! Lets see if my fellow brethren who use ac destroy the grid &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; /s, obvy I feel all us Canadians are in a state of just wtf..... Really tho wtf?

The words in the headline used just too get people in panic mode.

The problem is and always was the branding of these things. Its literally an air conditioner with a reversing valve. If you want an air conditioner, heat pumps should be the way to go as they are the exact same technology - plus the government might throw you some money to get one. I think labeling these as the solution for heating isnt how we should be going about this. It should have been to encourage Canadians who would *otherwise get an air conditioner only* to get a heat pump instead. Heat pumps will never be more efficient than a furnace in the winter (especially in Prairie winters), but they are cheaper to heat your home if it is 5 degrees above zero. *Also someone remind the governing party that subsidies are inefficient ways to encourage market change.*

Enough of this landlord bullying. Government needs to step in and stomp these assholes. If you cant manage a building that allows people to just live normal lives than you need to go. Landlords in BC can pound sand Stick it where the sun doesnt shine slumlords. "In an email to CBC News, B.C.s minister of housing said he hopes landlords and tenants will work together to find solutions" One day maybe the BC NDP will actually take a stand on something to help people. Until then rest assured if you are dying in your apartment from heat they will be very concerned. right on. so these landlords dont want ac installed, despite the single most deadly environmental instance in Canada being the heat dome in BC, because they are too cheap to upgrade electrical? Typical CBC article raises an important issue but doesn’t get anywhere helpful. A removable unit that draws less than what the apartment is rated for cannot be a material breach of the tenancy agreement. I got evicted because of this. Landlord decided the house was uninhabitable because of wiring, didn’t want to pay to fix. Now the home sits empty in burnaby The main issue is that there is no regulation to not have AC in housing. Try to buy a house or get a rental that has no heat built in. AC has been considered a luxury and not mandated to be included in builds like heat, or running water. As we have now locked in the heating of our planet, this will just get worse and worse. So like employers having to pay minimum wage because it’s mandated, all housing units will have to be mandated to have AC and possibly retro fitted, at the very least for vulnerable citizens. And yes blah blah who’s gonna pay blah blah. Remember when asbestos was removed? Buildings were retrofitted for earthquakes? This is here now. People will die from heat where and when they didn’t before. Until it’s mandated, nothing will happen because capitalism greed. If many employers could pay less than minimum wage you bet your ass they would (especially considering how they pissed and moaned and had tantrums of it being raised).
