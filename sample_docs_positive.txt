Id think that most of the mini-split systems are in homes that dont have FHA. Of those that are, there are a few reasons - if its a newer build, or at least the furnace is newer, it may make sense to use continue to use that as a backup. A ducted system is going to cost substantially more, so if the oil furnace isnt near end of life, it may not make economic sense. Older homes that probably should be switched may not have adequately sized ducting. We did the switch from oil furnace to ducted heat pump, but it made sense - the furnace nearing end of life, the oil tank was due for replacement, our ducting worked, etc. It was never going to make sense to go ductless given those factors on top of our house design (4-lvl split). There are only so many homes that have a central duct system vs those with baseboard/wood stove. Installing a central heat pump in a home without an existing central duct system can be absurdly expensive. Also, the cost to install a central heat pump is considerably more than a mini split. Even in a home with an existing central duct system. The mini split alone will still do wonders to supplement the existing oil furnace and cool in the summer. I suspect some installers only know how to do mini splits because they are so easy and simple to install. Lastly MrCool mini spilts are now available in Canada. These are DIY. Senville units have always been available here. These are advanced DIY. I dont know of any DIY units available for a central system nor where one could source one.

There are heat pump units that work to -20 or so, then you dont need a gas heater at all, and if you get a heat pump water heater, you can disconnect from gas and save significantly in fees. But, apparently you really need good insulation to make that work, as they really dont output heat on our coldest days. Not that this in any way helps your decision lol. As a heat pump is just an AC that runs in reverse, if youre going to get an AC anyway, might as well make it a heat pump. Heat pumps are pretty awesome if you can afford it, since you only really need the furnace in winter not sure if I would go high end, but since already spending 17k, what’s 20k at that point I have a heat pump - a Mitsubishi. Had it for 7 years. It works to heat our house down to about -25 to -30C and then a backup heater kicks in. We have double thick walls packed with insulation, so the backup heater doesn’t have to work very hard to maintain the temperature, but if you have a standard house, it may up your electricity bill a lot depending on how long the cold snap is. We’re net zero, so we try not to use the a/c unless we really need to, but we do use it occasionally and it works great. We also have solar to offset the electricity costs. For us, a big part of the savings is that we don’t have to pay a gas bill at all and the super insulated house helps minimize our heating and cooling costs. For you, you’d need to look at the cost of electricity vs gas and how much you’re going to need to figure out which is the better option for you, but you definitely don’t need both types of furnace. A heat pump is more than capable of heating your house (our model heats 3500sq feet).   Check out cold climate air source heat pumps (ccASHP). If you Google it there was a study done through the U of C. IIRC it basically said it’s not worth it for the money savings, but it may be depending on political forecasts (carbon taxes, green incentives, etc).

 Heat pump ppl: Experience / thoughts / advice on using Mysa heat pump thermostats? We just had a heat pump installed. Looking into getting the Mysa thermostat to control the heat pump / each head. (We already have Mysa thermostat for our baseboards - which we basically don’t use now, and our heat pump is *not* wifi controlled). Just looking for advice about the ones for heat pumps — yay or nay / why or why not? TIA:) Was just chatting with my neighbour who installs HVAC and heat pumps commercially. He doesnt see the need for the Mysa. "They (mini splits) react way too slow for that type of control (setback)". I have a Mysa for our mini split! It’s been super great. Easy to just plug in, pair with the mini split remote and off you go. I like being able to control the fan speed and direction from my phone instead of searching for the remote. Also we keep our house at a lower temp during the night time and Mysa manages all of that for us, we save energy and money! Once we installed our Mini split and Mysa our baseboard heaters never turned on again. Super great! Heat pump is a set it and forget it device, based on everything Ive read. Set your desired temperature and leave it alone. It uses less energy to maintain the temperature than it does to bring the house up to desired temperature after a setback. Use the Mysa money for air sealing and insulation. ~~Also - Mysa devices are for baseboard heaters which are meant to be cycled on and off.. They are not meant to control a device like a heat pump. The constant power cycling for the heat pump might not be good for the electronics.~~ I was unaware of the mini split device offered by Mysa. I could see that being useful for the other features it offers, not strictly for set back.

I live in a 1994 mobile home (1500sf) and we have a 16 year old York central heat pump, with backup resistive heaters in the inside air handler. The unit isnt rated to work in heat pump mode below freezing but it seems to be able to keep us nice and warm in heat pump mode, with only a few brief uses of the resistive heating, even at -10. If we ever replace it Ill likely go with a ducted mini-split but this old one is great, works down to any temp we get, and is cheap to operate. New in 2022 Samsung heat pump. Heats perfectly at minus 10 degrees Our 18000 BTU, 21 SEER Mitsubishi is heating our 1970’s 1260 sq ft rancher just fine. Holding at 20 C Colwood duplex. We have a dual-head split Samsung MaxHeat that was specced to -15degC; working like a hot damn, keeping it nice and toasty. Ours is holding the temperature. Its working harder than normal, but the temp in the house is consistent. I wasnt sure how well it would work when its this cold, but Im impressed. Keeping up for the most part. Further away from the head unit is a bit cool but I think that is more to do with the crap insulation we have in our walls. Ours is rated to -20 so should be fine. Ours has been fine (installed end of October). You can get units that are 100% efficient until -14c which we will never hit. For cities like Calgary, you can get ones that used a store supply of water under your foundation or pipes that go far underground where it’s not has cold. I grew up with one that had coolant that went under ground. It worked fine all winter back east. The main thing is that it works and cost 1/3 to heat in winter. A lot more savings if your using baseboards. It sucks. Its warm near it. Yet also cold near it. My bedroom apart from it is freezing. In an old house.

################################################################################

I thought about it, but instead installed independent electric heaters - every room has its own electric heater. Everyone told us we were dumb, but were three years in and its been cheaper than a central propane furnace, and cheaper than my neighbours who have an identical house with a heat pump system. Its zoned heating. We only heat the rooms/spaces were using to a comfortable temp; otherwise we lower them to 17°. An added advantage is that aside from vacuuming the dust out at the start of the season, there is no maintenance. It was significantly cheaper to purchase and install an electric heater in every room than install a central heating system. And, if a heater craps out its just that one room, not the whole house - and theyre not expensive to replace. I havent installed a heat pump for the home but my heat pump water tank has saved me tons off my natural gas bill. Yep. I’m a 20 year hvac journeyman who just installed a 19 seer inverter heat pump in my house 2 weeks ago. I used Emporia to monitor my energy usage in real time. I’m forecasting my electricity usage to be roughly double by the time the billing cycle is complete. So from roughly ~650kwh/m to 1300kwh/m Operational data from the system has been confirmed as working flawlessly both by myself, and from my contacts at the manufacturer. This unit has a COP approaching 4.0 under the outside conditions it’s currently operating in. When NG is being sold at $2.90/GJ, on the open market, and a COP of less than 1.0, heat pumps make zero sense from an operating cost perspective compared to utility supplied natural gas. I will be using this system for cooling-only (my original intent, as my old AC was ancient) going forward. This is a common story sadly

################################################################################

This is a good reminder. My house isnt too bad but I need to make sure I have some cool spots for her to get some relief. There is portable Air conditioner at bestbuy on sale right now going for $300. I would just trap all your pets in one room with the AC on You can put a towel over an ice pack and theyll lay on it to keep cool. I have two big ones the size of a persons back, that I rotate. I buy freezies from the dollar store wrap a hand towel around them and put them on my dog like a blanket. Cheap and effective. I save single serve yogurt containers and fill them with water and a bit of dog food and freeze them. My dog loves them and it keeps him hydrated. frozen food, dump water on them (they will be mad but whatever) I stick my top sheet in the fridge. Make a cold bed and swap out with another sheet. I thought cats could regulate their body temperature

################################################################################

We had a major replacement of our HVAC and hot water system. Our old furnace was 30 years old and the water tank 20 and sprung a leak. So our decision to upgrade wasnt just voluntary. The Green Homes and Enbridge rebates really helped and are necessary incentives to get you to consider reducing natural gas instead of just whatever is the cheapest available. Its too bad Ontario had cancelled their rebates. So our $20,000 heat pump/high eff furnace, tankless water heater and attic insulation turned into $12,000 (after tax). The heat pump is a bit of a learning curve for what to expect. With a gas furnace, youre used to a long blast of hot air coming from the floor vents. The heat pump is much more gentle. Its a slow and steady transfer of heat from the outside to the inside. The fan now runs independantly from the thermostat as you control how many times an hour it turns on. So during spring and fall, you may want to have your fan on longer to blast the air through your vents. Keep an eye on your Enbridge bill and start to record your actual gas meter reading. You may want to start submitting your readings instead of Enbridge doing the estimate. And you know your electricity consumption will increase. Its a shock. Remember its not electric heating. Its electricity that transfers heat from the outside to the inside. Its the same as during the summer heat waves when everybody is running their air conditioners. I have an air-source heat pump system. It works fine down to around -15 but beyond that it can’t keep up, despite being rated to -27. I’ve had to use supplemental resistance heaters when it gets really cold. Not in a house, but we have a heat pump in our mid-rise condo. About 1000 square feet. Our total hydro bill is about $60 per month, which includes all our heating and air conditioning. I know others with similar sized condos that do not have heat pumps and they’re paying quite a bit more for hydro. Ours was installed by the developer but recently one of our neighbours had theirs malfunction and they were quoted about $4.5k for a new one.

################################################################################

Its best to always keep them on and really have them set at a constant temperature you may want to minus 1.5° at night. Im pretty sure the dakin can fit in the inverter unit so it can run at various speeds and should be extremely efficient, but yes, if you were using oil heat before your electric bill will increase. I also have a ducted, and it runs like the furnace did, only when it needs to supply heat to match the thermostat As others mentioned, your fan might be set to on instead of auto. Or your temperature might be set high enough that it never reaches that to shut off. What is your temperature set to, and where is the thermostat that measures the current temperature? Also check to see if the mode is set to "auto", " heat" or "cool" As for increase in electrical costs. Yes, you will more all year round as compared to an oil furnace without an air conditioner. But your total heating costs will be less as compared to oil. If you can find the manufacturer and model number if the heat pump you can google to find the user manual And for all thing related to home maintenance, YouTube can be your best friend. Lots of very knowledgeable people with great content While the heat pump will use electricity, it doesnt "create" heat with the electricity like an electric baseboard heater. It moves heat from outdoors (theres heat out there, even when its cold out) to indoors (and the other way around in summer). This is more efficient than the baseboard heater, using a lot less electricity. Some heat pumps may have a heating element for really cold times, and will use more power if it comes on.

Hooking up portable a/c - still have to to the window install on it. Throwing two 9x11 ice gel packs into the freezer. When its hot Ill put one under my pillow before bed, and flip my pillow over when I get in - cool pillow feels so good. A few hours later Ill flip my pillow and the pack under there will still be partly frozen, so the pillow is cool when flipped. Its amazingly helpful to stay cool when sleeping. Going to cooling centres at the community centres. Running all our fans. Sleeping with ice pad in the bed. Running the shower on cold and closing the door and getting a few minutes of fake AC. Hiding in my room, heat sucks at the best of times. Bring back the more comfortable, cozier rain and overcast. Nothing cozy about the sun. Heat? You call 30 degree Celsius hot? Beat the heat? What heat? Oh you mean the 6 degrees above room temperature? Will be in Vegas this weekend for a friends bachelor party where its forecasted to be 34\*C but with 10% humidity as opposed to 40+ here. Staying in my apt with a/c on.. :) Ill be out enjoying summer. I mean finally its warm and sunny. #summer. Its a thing that happens every year. First nice weekend and yall freaking out. Heat? WHAT heat?! Forecast is calling for a high of MAYBE 25C. When it starts hovering around 35C, then we can talk. Until then just enjoy the pleasant weather. > Anything else I should do? Book a cruise to check out the BC coast and seek out an Alaskan glacier. Go out, enjoy a hike, go to the beach. 1000X more ways to deal with heat than rain for me at least. I’m a big fan of wearing sweaters for the first few weeks of the heat going up. Climatized myself to handle it when it gets real hot. I’ve always had friends from Cali come here in our summers and wear sweaters saying they’re cold. So there’s something to it cause it works for me. Keeping my blinds closed, lots of sparkling water in the fridge (and in my tum), walks in the later afternoon/evening when it’s cooler. I once ate so much icecream my poo cameout cold.

 Canada records 1st 40s-C temperature of 2023 in Lytton, as B.C. heat wave gets underway  find it wierd, it says 1st 40s c in 2023 in lytton. Then i went to check out the records and ah... i see:  I just want to point out that Trail was 47 for three days last year, but because the weather station was previously on a hill in Warfield, it recorded a high of 43. Its like five or six hundred feet of elevation difference. Theyve recently moved it to Warfield elementary school, but its still a couple hundred feet out of the valley bottom. It annoys me because the weather is always two degrees warmer than what the station shows or predicts. Trail is consistently as hot as Osoyoos. I know literally no one cares except me. I just need to get it off my chest. Wow all those record years are from the 2000s Minor point that will get me downvoted, but: >In response to the prolonged heat wave, municipalities throughout B.C. — from Saanich on Vancouver Island to Kamloops in the Central Interior — ... Kamloops is in the Southern Interior [removed] Extreme weather is going to get worse (and more expensive) Probably a good idea to reduce emissions as much as we can. Seems like it’s only BC that is having above normal heat this summer. The rest of the country is pretty average temperatures. Oh no. Anyway... The flooding after this one is going to be catastrophic. So the place that hit 50°C a couple of years ago is still the hottest place in Canada? Im shocked. Shocked I tell you. Hopefully this time it doesnt burn to the ground a week later. Wow. Summer. It’s hot. Wild.

Prep your bed with extra blankets for tonight( think of it as an out door camping adventure) Head out and camp somewhere warm like a mall or a library, Restaurant, gym. Head back home when your ready to go to sleep. Prep for bed and climb under those blankets( your body heat should keep you warm) Hopefully the power back on when you wake up If not just repeat. If you live in a house with a sump pump, Id say powering that today is your biggest priority. Its going to be a wet, melty, sloppy day. High groundwater. I predict many flooded basements. Exercise indoors, and raise your heart rate every 1 hour. Luckily its relatively warm outside Start burning all the books you have inside eyour oven Exactly the reason why my wife insisted on keeping a wood burning stove...just in case. Stay well all, that was a amazing storm. Layers It was already restored, why don’t people delete old irrelevant posts? This is why every home owner should have a portable generator for outages. In the summer you can keep your fridge running and sub pump. In the winter have a couple heaters going Head to the mall, head to a restaurant, head to the movies, visit an art gallery, play some sports. Lots to do. Well go in a room with no windows and close the door. Put something at the bottom of the door so no cold air comes in and light a candle and wear layers and layers of clothing Cuddle Space heater or give the pipes a handy (/s) Put a tea candle in a small terra cotta pot. Then put that pot in a bigger terra cotta pot. It will heat a small room easily. 🙄 power once went out for 4 days straight where i live. You’ll be fine. Wear 2 coats and layers of sweaters

I am in the process of doing this. There is tons of threads on here. Initial audit was 550$ paid when they come. They checked my house, furnace and ac, windows, attic insulation and did a blower door test. Few days later I got the report stating I qualify for for rebate for windows, hvac and attic insulation and air sealing. The breakdown for each item is available online. You get quotes from 1-3 vendors decide who you Want to go with and go ahead with the work. (Goverment does have a 40k interest free loan thats available if you want to go that way, but you only get that after all the work has been completed and final audit is done) also if your going loan route you need them to approve it before any work starts. After all your work is done you get your final audit for another 250$ They submit report then 8-10 weeks you get the rebate check. You also get $600 back just from the audits. So they cost you 200$ give or take out of pocket Its a 4-12 month process. Sounds a little dodgy to me. I haven’t done one myself but the $735 just to evaluate the house seems a little high. I don’t think some home inspections would cost that much. I would get a quote from another company or 2 first before signing anything with these guys. Basically that, except they conducted an after instal audit as well. We were hesitant at first but friends of our parents had it done last year and received their rebate. We are on month 5 and waiting for the rebate cheque. Side note: we have noticed a drop in electricity usage so far this summer compared to last year, but the big change is the ratio of peak energy versus off peak.

################################################################################

I don’t know if it is worth it if you have access to natural gas. But, if you’re in a more remote region and have to pay for delivery of furnace fuel or propane, it is definitely worth it. I currently live in a remote are in NWO and switched from furnace fuel to a heat pump and it currently saves me $700 to $900/month on heating. If you do look at them, look at the different ratings and get something that will work in your area. I have a Gree cold weather heat pump and is 79% efficient at -33C and will easily heat my home till -40C (I have the aux heat to kick in at -35C). The greener homes grant I am not as enthusiastic about; it took over 2 years to get everything settled from inspection to final grant payment. Can we use the Greener Home Grants to retrofit a heat pump into a condo building built in the 1980s? The heating from the baseboard heaters and the cooling from the wall air conditioner both suck big time. I had a cold climate heat pump installed recently alongside a natural gas furnace as a backup. I run mine until it gets down to -15 and then the furnace kicks in since the efficiency of the heat pump drops after that point. As carbon pricing increases and natural gas gets more expensive in the coming years, the economics will make sense to run the heat pump when it gets even colder. With the federal and provincial rebates available, going with a heat pump is a no-brainer—especially if youre running an electric furnace as it will really help cut costs on milder days.

 Any experience with heat pump water heaters in Northern Ontario? Hi, I live in northern Ontario near Sudbury. New natural gas rates are killing my budget and Im looking for ways to reduce monthly costs. Keep hearing about heat pumps but dont trust them for this climate and the online info is not Canadian specific. Would appreciate advice from anyone in northern Ontario with first hand experience with heat pumps for water heating or furnaces? are you happy with your set up? Thanks Edit: thanks everyone for your advice. It sounds like.... - Geothermal heat pumps are the best for new buildings or easy retrofit. - Newer heat pumps work for cold weather but need a backup (electrical, wood or gas). Old models dont work. - For water heating the best option is still a natural gas tankless heater if you cannot get a geothermal combo. Did I get this right. Thank you again. Not Northern Ontario, but someone here in Ottawa did a post about how their heat pump did over a cold weekend (below -30C): Should be useful and the OP will probably answer if you have any questions. We have a water furnace in our home but it works with a geothermal heating system (water pipes underneath our front yard installed when the house was being built). The water furnace heats air that gets pushed through ducts throughout the house. Works super well. Not sure if its feasible or worth it to get geothermal pipes installed on an already existing home and not sure if a water furnace works without the geothermal pipe system. It is nice to have central air and no gas bill though. We pay less for hydro in a bigger house than we did last year in a smaller house that had gas fireplace + electric baseboards. Also cools air in the summer months for AC. Really cool system that Im going to try to learn more about through the years. Is gas going up for you? Here in Ottawa it’s coming down this year I think.

################################################################################

I keep box fans on the floor in a few rooms in the house so my pupper always has moving air nearby. Lately hes been sleeping a few feet in front of the fans. Also no walks between 2-7. We will go for an early morning long walk then chill during the day or do a few quick yard pees then a longer walk after 8. There are also cooling bandanas that work ok too. I usually stick a couple of cooling towels, the microfiber ones, in the freezer. My guy likes them draped over him when we come back in from a walk. Also, my number one pet peeve, is seeing people walk their dogs on the pavement in the heat of the day. If it’s too hot for you to walk, barefoot, or keep your hand on the pavement for more than 10 seconds, it’s too hot for your dogs. we have a tiny rack that fits over top of them since they dont like direct contact with the ice packs/damp cloths. The rack was from our old freezer so is about 8 inches tall. We put ice packs in damp cloths and put them on top. Keeps them very cool! They seem to appreciate it and will chill under it for quite a while. I’m Making my chickens compostsicles. Maybe you could do something similar with some wet food ? If you have attic vents (peak and end vents), then open up the attic hatch. All the heat will go up into the attic and out the vents. Sleep downstairs, and put ice packs in a shallow container and in front of the fans. Have you considered ceiling fans? Also installing UV blocking film on windows is a good way to drop the temps. I installed them on my moms windows and it made a noticeable difference. I bought them at Canadian Tire Hillside

I grew up in the Caribbean and wore hoodies over my school uniform in my last 3 years of high school. Even today, many years later, I wear hoodies in the sun (if not a hoodie, a long sleeve shirt) and for some reason, I feel less warm. The sun isn’t bashing on my skin so it’s cooler to me. I’m also one of those people who wears shorts and flip flops in winter, even in the snow. As once it’s above 5 degrees, I’m good. For me it’s two things, one is just being so skinny and cold all the time, and the other is insecurity about looking so damn skinny in shorts and t shirt Be prepared for the worst, I guess? My son wears jeans and a sweater 98% of the year: rain (no jacket), snow (no toque), and sun. He isnt fond of how his legs look right now, and feels more comfortable in longer sleeves and pants. Hes willing to accept discomfort from the weather to be more comfortable with himself. So...Ive stopped nagging/judging. Except when we went up north and it was -30. I made him wear a jacket then. Otherwise, eh. I find Vancouver sun very intense and wear a UV protection hoodie zipped to neck. It’s light and actually gives a cooling effect. If only I could find something alike to cover my face, I’d do so. Overall, I find myself always being covered either because of rain or sun. Don’t really know if I’d ever have a chance to wear those pretty open shoulders summer dresses. The downside of having sunburn makes it not worth it. I wear long pants and a shirt in this weather because I protect my body parts from the sun 😄also 29 is not 35. It’s warm, but not crazy hot imho Was just in Seattle and everyone was bundled up like crazy, it was mega hot

My brother replaced his furnace and AC with a heat pump about a year ago. Its been stellar, I intend to install one myself when our furnace dies. They work passed-30. It’s just that they are not as effective savings wise. I didn’t understand that part either. You would need to keep all your room doors open to get heat in specific rooms. ( if it’s the wall mounted kind) Then get an electric heat pump water heater and you are set! Everyone I know who has one, loves it. We need things that stack functions (do the job of heating as well as cooling.) Are we worried at all about heat pumps using HFCs? Please don’t come at me for this - I was so excited about heat pumps and then someone told me a lot of them use high-polluting refrigerants and I’ve been meaning to look into it but it seems like there are some experts here. A heat pump and air conditioner are essentially the same thing, they move heat from inside to outside or vice versus at an electrical efficiency of ~300%. They can be reversed so they can heat and cool by heat transfer rather than using electric resistive heat or burning gas. The technology is getting better but often below -20C the heat pump isn’t able to run properly and flips to electric resistive heat. Overall heat pumps are a great option, but they come with a slightly higher upfront cost. If you are looking at solar, electric resistive heat isn’t a practical solution. If you have questions, consider joining this slack group with people who are switching entirely to electricity in Ottawa: &#x200B;  So what i have read is that as the carbon tax increases, its going to be more and more worth it. We are just about at break even now. With energy costs last winter it definitely was I got a new furnace and air conditioner in 2020… is a heat pump worth getting now or should I hold off until a replacement is needed? Do you keep the furnace with the heat pump? I live in a house built in the 1800s so making it more energy efficient is a challenge but I’m plugging away at it.

 Heat warning issued for B.C.s North Coast as record-breaking heat wave set to peak for most of province  It was annoyingly hot this morning, but the groceries werent going to walk themselves home. Be a lot cooler if they did--literally. Todays temperature is about as hot as last summer got where Im at (32C). Tolerable, but annoying. I really hope rain is in everyones forecast! Gorgeous weather Outdoors camping time :) Its called summer.

I recommend that you get your energy assessment booked in soon. The federal Canada Greener Homes program might be stopping taking new applications as early as March. (We don’t know yet if it will be ended, extended or revised). There are several companies that deliver the assessment portion of the programs. They are listed on the Efficiency NS website. The Clean Foundation is the only non-profit one. That means you don’t pay tax on the assessment fee, and the money they get out of doing the assessment goes back into their environmental/education/social/climate related work around the province. They also have a large team of experienced advisors some of whom have been in the job for over a decade and they have the shortest wait list. Before booking your assessment, check if you qualify for the provincial HomeWarming program (free upgrades for low-moderate income households) or the federal Oil To Heat Pump Affordability (OHPA) program, which is an income contingent add on rebate program that requires you to be heated by oil primarily, earning under a certain threshold after tax, and that you’ve used at least 1000L of oil in the last twelve months (ask the prev owner for receipts if necessary). The OHPA program gives you an extra $5k on top of the $5k standard federal rebate for adding heat pumps to your home + associated costs. It does not require you to remove or stop using oil. In April this add on amount will be increasing to $10k. If you’re not dead set on getting rid of wood I’d recommend an add-on wood furnace it runs in tandem with your oil furnace, I installed one last year for around 6k and it costs me 3-4 cord worth of wood to heat my house now. And by heat I mean the kids are sleeping on top of the covers complaining now, whereas before I struggled to keep it at 20c with two full tanks a winter. Food for thought.

################################################################################

 Anyone install a heat pump recently? I’m thinking of replacing my oil forced air system with a ducted heat pump. Wondering if anyone has had one installed recently and roughly how much it ended up costing for the removal of oil tank/ furnace, 200 amp panel upgrade and heat pump install. Also, any HVAC company recommendations or ones to avoid would be greatly appreciated. I am in the Saint John area. Thanks in advance! Stickied for visibility. If you plan home renovation work around increased energy efficiency, start with NB Powers Save Energy NB site. There are provincial and federal programs available will save you a significant amount of money on things like heat pumps, insulation, and the like. **Do not start the work before an efficiency evaluation has been completed, or it will not count**. I converted from oil to forced air electric heat pump in 2015. It was well worth it. Im warm in the winter and cool in the summer and Ive saved a lot of money. It cost me around $13k at the time, including removal of oil and oil tank (make sure the company is bonded to remove oil/oil tanks). Im in the Fredericton area and had mine done by Martins Home Heating. My house is 1200 sq ft and they didnt need to upgrade my panel to 200 amp from its current amperage. We also had one installed, total cost was a little over $20,000. That includes panel upgrade and the oil tank being removed. We’ve only had it for a couple of month, but the heat is so much better. It’s going to be so nice having our entire home have AC

 Concerns grow over B.C. floods and wildfires amid rare May heat wave  I don’t understand why we continue to refer to heatwaves as rare. They are basically an annual occurrence, and the period of the year in which they occur is widening considerably, ranging from May to October now. It freaks me out seeing how many trees are already looking stressed after the last couple years and it’s supposed to be way hotter this summer.

################################################################################

I too have noticed the changes. I have had the aqicn.org and firesmoke sites open pretty much all summer and fall the past few years. I also bought the best air filter I could afford along with a bunch of refills after feeling the effects of a several poor aq days. I have no idea how people living with constant poor air quality/pollution manage. I’ve used blackout drapes for many years to manage the heat in my apartment. Unfortunately when it doesn’t cool down overnight this doesn’t cut it anymore. I feel lucky that our building is looking at converting a space to a cooling room for future heat events. I remember the first time I heard a politician just casually use the term “forest fire season,” as though it had always been a part of our lives. No it isn’t. And we shouldn’t accept it as normal. Good grief. Did you really need to include mention of a fictional drama? Just dooms day r us around here. That Dutch miniseries "Heat" was harrowing to watch but forces you to think about what happens to a city when the power goes out and waters shut off in a 40C+ heatwave.

I pay less than the rebate, most people do. we are loosing money on this its only the rich that have huge compounds and the businesses that are paying. Conservatives sure like to give the money from the poor to the rich. If the only thing that helped me (and thousands of others) afford food in july gets removed because of his antics, hes gonna have alot more to worry about than some re-election spectacle or corporate ball fondling appointments. Can we charge him with tax evasion now? These guys have stagnated the whole fucking province. Nobody can afford shit these days. Doesnt help that the provinces largest employer is ham-stringing 1000s of us on contracts. This place can burn for all I care now. Cool. There goes likely our carbon action quarterly payments. Felonious Premier. Which means people also wont be getting their rebate check? Great. People are again robbed by sp. 400/year what a 🤣🤣. The rebate is way more than this. **SO WE ARE LOOSING MONEY ON THIS PEOPLE** the people who drank Moe Coolaid are so dumb to understand this. Its $33.33 a month. And if you see the graph its for some 4 year old or a person with low IQ. But people will go crazy,. Sometimes I think sp supporters have an invisible tinfoil hat on them. Good stuff. Refreshing to see a politician who gets it. Taxing the air wont alter climate change Just so long as it doesn’t cost us our rebates. Or cost us money in some other way. But I already get paid $400 a year from the federal govts Climate Action Incentive. Carbon tax is a joke for Canada and a money grab for turdeau If we should tax anyone it should be china they are the world’s worst polluters. Canada is a drop in the ocean when it comes to pollution In the long run this will end up costing the people of Saskatchewan far less. There will be no legal action as the Liberals will not be able to bring this to a courtroom before the end of their term and the Conservatives will scrap any frivilious legal action the Libs attempted against us. A huge bipartisan victory for Saskatchewan! Good for Moe. Well done.

 You may be surprised by the air tightness of your home once the audit is completed. I know I was. Most of our drafts and air loss was from our attic access framing (not the door itself), and our outlets that dont have seals on them. Im in the process of getting a heat pump water heater (HPWH) installed after going down a similar path, but for solar reasons for us primarily. The HPWH wont have any cold weather issues as its in your conditioned space indoors, it will cool the room its in a bit though. Its more commonly called a hybrid water heater but its a heat pump ultimately, and run off your electrical panel. Rheem seems to be the main (only?) player in town, and they take a big 30amp breaker to run it so you may have some load management to deal with getting it put in. Theyre much more efficient than a pure electrical unit, but they may not save you money over a NG unit. Since it seems your weeks/months behind on a similar path we ended up deciding to add all the expected future load now EV/HPWH so that it can be factored into the solar design. Our thinking is that will allow us to max out the offset, and hopefully make the solar install more beneficial to us in the long run. Good luck with the decisions, the green homes program is going away this year too so tick tock, tick tock. > - Im on 100 amp service currently, but can upgrade to 120A without replacing the line into the house. Has anyone run into issues with a heat pump and heat pump HWH on 100A, or is it basically going to necessitate upgrading to 200A? Quick question how are you able to upgrade to 120A? Id love to get an additional 20amps of headroom.

################################################################################

 Yea youll qualify Anyone know if you’d qualify if adding a heat pump to now cover entire house if I already had one on one floor already? Also, what about panel upgrades needed to accommodate adding one? You should qualify, the process is definitely not as smooth as it could have been. I will note the program is winding down and changing, I do not know what it’s changing to. Quotes will be relative to the units, but be warty on which ones you get, make sure you ask for specs and compare them yourself. Generally I see 4-6k for singles and 9-14k on multis. Yes. I know someone who got rebates for replacing old heat pump with new heat pump. The big Federal rebates are drying up and not taking new applicants after March 2024, so if you’re going for the 5k you’ll want to start the process ASAP No word if a new program will be in its place yet. No at least when I got two installed it was only for people replacing oil heat. Did get the cheap financing through NS power. Is it means tested? Do you have to make below a certain household income amount? Avoid Amerispec when doing assessment.

 Mango lassi during lunch to combat the heat 🌞  That looks absolutely perfect and delicious. I’ve always wanted to try a Lassi drink. Maybe at least say where its from to make it somewhat relevant to the winnipeg sub Where dis? The lassi looks really good, but its kind of weird to have whipped cream on top! Now I want one! Oh yea thats the good stuff 😋 Oh no, the gorreh lokh have caught on…

 Is there a place that does custom embroidery or heat press for a jersey? I have one blank jersey that I want a name and numbers on. Royal sports, jets gear(they likely only carry jets name plates), keener jerseys. I did look into this about a year ago and from what I found royal sports was the cheapest Blue Cheeks on Sargent near Arlington does custom printing on stuff. Handmade in Winnipeg fb group will have some folks no doubt Winnipeg outfitters Jets gear can do any hockey jersey for any team really 99.9% of the time. Usually just bring a printed pic of what you want and they can do it. I know people who have gotten almost every NHL team jerseys done at jets gear Obligatory Keener plug Thanks all for the recommendations! All Canadian Emblem does the protwill work for the Jets store, and Id venture to guess Royal Sports and Uptown Sports also use them.  Embroidery and Engraving Concepts is in st.vital mall  Source for sports on pembina

 Metro Vancouver college to use holy grail of sewage pipes to heat campus  VCC gonna be hot as shit soon not a new concept. Been going around in a lot of European downtowns specifically Scandinavian cities to help keep the winter snow melting. Glad Canadians are giving a damn about more efficient engineering. Much of False Creek is already on this system. :)  Sounds great for the environment, but I guess the higher cost will be added to the tuition.

 Recommendation for local companies who install reflective window film for heat reduction? Thanks in advance! I haven’t checked the validity to this but have been told on a few occasions that doing this may void your warranty on a window’s sealed unit. Have also been told that the company doing such work takes on the liability. Something to ask. I used Spectra to have Llumar NX series film on the exterior of my windows and theres a significant improvement. Prior to having it the heat caused the overlay on my cheap Ikea shelving to fall right off and the rooms seemed like they were 30+ degrees. After getting it, this past heat wave has been barely noticable. If your windows arent too large you can do it yourself. Home Depot sells a number of different window film options. Youtube the install, fairly easy. Ill also second Matt from Spectra. Hes been great to deal with! Scott at Sundown Solar did ours. Really nice guy. 403-253-0047 Bee-Cool is one company that does that. No experience with them myself.

 Specialty heat resistant paint I’ve been to all the major hardware stores, and a few of the paint stores too. I’m looking for gloss high heat paint. Found some at Home Depot that said gloss. It was not. I need to paint the front edge of my black stove that is scuffed and scratched to bare metal. Take a look for engine or manifold paint at your nearest autoparts joint Walkers on faithful is probably your best bet Is it paint or enamel? Usually even the gloss ones come out a bit matte. Caliper paint is probably the best. Other alternative is to pull door and have powder coated There is a porcelain paint you can get at Rona. I used it on my stove. It comes in a little bottle that looks like nail polish. You can use it for fixing cracks and scuffs on your stove, sinks and bath tub etc. you just need to know the brand of stove you have to get the correct white. It’s called Masters Porc-a-fix. Porcelain touch up glaze. If you go to Rona, ask for Donna. She’ll be able to help you Have you tried spray paint? You can spray it into a little container and then brush it onto your stove. Heres something from their website.  If you can remove the part, you could look at getting it powder coated, otherwise engine bay paint. Stove paint is flat black from factory. Unless you specifically want gloss, you’re better off to use the standard flat black stove paint because it’s so easily matched. Gloss will not wear as well. Stove paint is also really easy to find. Just google it.

 Heat Pump Recommendations for heat pump supplier/installer in Metro? We went with heat pump solutions last year. Used the Canada Greener Homes Grant and the Canada Greener Homes loan program. Such a game changer Greenfoot Solutions was great for us back in February. We got the GE heat pump and have been loving it so far. Our March power bill was $130 cheaper than last year’s. The A/C is great too now during the summer months. We went with daikin through hot frost. Pretty happy with it so far; especially today My coworker does mini splits as a side gig. He’s booked up a month ahead though. He did installs for 4-5 guys here , they are all pretty happy with his work. I can DM his contact info if you want it. He’s cheaper than the big outfits ( no overhead). We used Hot Frost, they installed two Daikin pumps in our house and made quick work of a half tangly installation. That was 3 years ago and we havent had a hitch with them. Ran us $4500 but that was with a steep in-store rebate and then that home renovation rebate that came out sometime during covid so they stacked and saved us a nice chunk of change I had coleair solutions. Presale was great post sale experience was not. Would not recommend. Heat Pump Solutions!

 Questions for people who have bought a heat pump system for your homes. How did it go? Did it lower you heating bill in the winter? Is there a minimum lot size to be able to get a ground based heat pump system? How much did the rebates affect the cost for the system? Most normal city lots are going to be hard to put in an affordable ground source heat pump. The only way to do it on a standard lot is to use a vertical loop, which means drilling several holes up to a few hundred feet down - and that aint cheap. On a rural (or very large city) property, you can often go with a horizontal loop, which only needs a backhoe to install. In the city, an air source pump is usually the practical answer. With the limitation that youll still need some sort of auxiliary heat below about -25 outside Ive been fighting with three vendors to get quotes together for a ground source heat pump for 3.5 months. I did apply for and was approved into the greener homes grant program, which added about a month of delay waiting for the energy audit provider, and am still hoping the ground loop will get quoted and installed this fall. Once I eventually get quotes and details, Ill share a new post. I put in an air source one along with a new gas furnace for temps below -17 recently via the greener home grant/loan. No opinion yet regarding its operation in the winter as this will be the first one. As an AC unit, the heat pump is the best one ive ever owned though.

################################################################################

It’s been about 6 years since I’ve turned on anything other than the infloor heating in my bathroom. The last time I actually needed heat was when it was colder than -10 for over a week. Edit: face southwest on 5th floor of a downtown low rise. I relented and turned the thermostat on this week already because the prayer plant stopped praying and the cat started sniffling lol. Its just when its hovering around zero that it starts to get a bit chilly in here. The biggest factors would be the windows (double pane and/or size as in floor to ceiling) and what side you are facing. When I lived facing south I hardly ever turned my heat on in the winter as on sunny days it would heat the entire condo for a long time. Also, depending on what the temperature is set in the common areas on your floor you will get some heating as well with air being forced under your door. Then consider what type of flooring you have an underlay then there will be some insulating properties or conduction from suites above and below. Moreover, hardwood flooring and especially tile will be colder say versus carpeting. Your sensitivity to cold is another factor. My girl friend needs the place toasty and has to have the heat turned up. Never. South facing and my apartment holds heat like a mofo. We still have one of our air conditioners out, although it’s getting very little use these days. We turned it on briefly when it dropped below -5, but other than that… never. I found it depended on concrete vs. woodframe. I used to be in a concrete building on the 25th floor and didnt have to turn on my heat for the entire 3 years I lived there. Recently moved into a new wood frame and turned on the heat a couple weeks ago. Heating now is radiant in-floor so it was more for warming the toes in the morning than the actual house being cold. I got a lot of windows so my place can heat up if it’s sunny. These days I’m still running air con till about 4 pm then it switch to heat for the evening

 Record breaking heat possible in Niagara today  as of 1pm its 27.8C with a humidex of 32.6 here in Waterloo.

Youll be interested in this post: Theyre talking about how their heat pump did at -31.5C. Summary: It works fine. Theres good discussion in the comments too. They do get less efficient at colder temps, so it sort of depends on how much overhead you have on the capacity of your heat pump, to the max load youre going to need. Heres a link to a Youtube Video by The Conscious Builder which shares the experience of a local home owner and discusses the costs and the savings. For this homeowner there was very little savings. Pay close attention to the ROI calculation. The calculation isnt based on savings on bills as there basically arent any. Instead, it is based on eliminating paying carbon tax from home heating and then using the estimated Climate Action Initiative Rebate to calculate the ROI. The argument being your goal should be to completely eliminate having to pay carbon taxes and still receive the Climate Action Initiative rebates. The challenge with this thinking is you should not apply the entire value of the rebate in your calculations unless you have totally eliminated paying carbon tax, and this includes fuel for your vehicle, for instance. Another challenge is that estimated future rebates are based on the Climate Action Initiative as it exists now. Any government can make changes to the program and we have the Cons party currently campaigning that they would scrap the carbon tax if elected.  I have a thermopump and I love it. I cant say I noticed a change in my electric bill as a result of it because I got it pretty early on when I moved in. It heats, has a dehumidifier, and an AC included. Ive never needed to use the AC, the dehumidifier is really good at keeping my place cool. (It helps that Im at ground level though.) I believe its rated up to -20C at which point its recommended you use a secondary source. So on days where its -40 Ill sometimes put the heat on in the living room. And I still use my electric heaters in the bedrooms because theyre farther from the thermopump so the heat doesnt quite reach.

################################################################################

We have a forced air high efficiency NG furnace and a new Heat pump. We started using the furnace last night. Heat pump was doing ok/fine but the “feels like” heat that comes from a hot flame beats the slow and steady heat pump in this outside temperature range. We will switch back to heat pump once it warms up a bit. Just glad I am not in Calgary right now. They work okay when its like below -3 ish. And get worse as the temp drops. Honestly, they kinda suck compared to conventional heating below -2. Before -3 they are great. Working fine here, -10, feels like -19. Our mini splits have been great. We did have a defrosting issue when it had a coolant leak, but that was an improper install. Fixed that and have had no other troubles. Ours is a secondary heat source for us though, we primarily use the woodstove (we arent in the city). If we lived somewhere with more reliable winter power, it would be pretty tempting to just use it as a primary! Fujitsu 2 ton with two head units in our 1300 sq ft house. Doing great and keeping everyone warm! Working fine. For now. Running great. Windows need replacing though certain spots in the extremities of the house are chilly. Steady!! Steady!! Very happy. That little heat pump is definitely working but we are warm inside. Also helps that the house has 6" of rockwool insulation on the outside. No cold spots. We also have heat recovery ventilator (HRV) delivering 75 cfm to the house so there is also turnover of air. My heat pump has sent out system fault codes when it goes below freezing the last two times. Emergency heat keeps the house warm but that’s straight electricity so not much savings there. York heat pump made in 2012. Ive been seeking solutions but the error codes aren’t visible to me. I’ve powered it off from the breaker, (which often works to get it going), reset the thermostat, took the filter out, (which fairly new and quite clean looking). Anyone out there have any other ideas??? I’ve had to use auxiliary heat on mine. Its working hard - not currently succeeding at keeping it at 18.5 but its trying!

################################################################################

Heat pump is always on. But I havent turned my furnace on yet. Usually I dont need to until it gets really cold. Turn the heat on?!?!?! I still have my windows open. Our heat pump has kicked in a few mornings - it is on right now. We keep the house at 21 though which I think is pretty warm to some people. I woke up cold this morning. Gonna break out the flannel and comforter! I had to recently. The Temps are getting colder and we are getting snow soon. Thank the Lord the heat is included in rent. Its an old building so were encouraged to leave heat on at all times to avoid pipes bursting. Not yet I turned the heat pumps on yesterday! I think the question should be “who hasn’t turned their heat on yet?”… Heat on? I only just closed the window. I had the woodstove going all day. Never!!! Well probably later this week lol Not yet- but barely hanging on. The boiler is on when we use hot water so there is a bit of residual heat from that. Plus I had crock pot and bread maker on -and 4 candles. Windows open here. Weeks ago. House is freezing Not me! Heat pump - yes! Switch it to cool when it’s 20c out and back to heat for nighttime. Electric baseboards - no not yet, not until it’s reeeeally cold. just living room until tonight, now several rooms! ❄ heat pump has bean set at 21 since summer 15.5 degrees in the evening a few days ago. Holding strong. The last 3weeks it’s been on, heat pumps so, pretty negligible power usage at these temps. ThinkQ is showing me I’ve used ~100kwh between both units since turning them on 3weeks ago. So like less than $1/day. Honestly the heat pumps are major even during our coldest months. Peak month in 2022 for minisplit usage was February, totalled around 1000kwh between both, like $6/day. Typically around $150/mo to heat the whole place with minisplits, temp set at 22°C usually Been on for a week or so. Living next to the ocean with the wind, don’t really have much choice. Calendar still says October, so no.

################################################################################

I’m in the process of getting a geothermal heat pump installed. The costs are coming in at: 5 k for upgrade to 200 amp panel. 4 k to upgrade ducting as it needs runs optimized for heat pumps. 35 k for the heat pump and two wells for 400 ft deep. 4 k for landscaping once they are gone. 3500 to remove chimney that’s no longer needed and always leaks. Hope that helps! No Central system from Degree. From electric forced air. 14k Im wondering if anyone knows who around Fredericton could service a Frigidaire heat pump. This was our first winter in our first home, and I have the feeling that our pump isnt working as efficiently as it should. Probably a thermostat issue. The temp in the main room can drop a good 5 or 6 degrees below target before the heat pump decides to start blowing, so we bounce from boiling to chilly and back all winter. Around 2250 for just install had baseboard heaters only before got 2 units one basement on main floor I didn’t do it recently but did it in 2018. Only comment is make sure your ductwork can accommodate the increased airflow. The temp of the heat pump is cooler than a forced air oil furnace. It moves more air to compensate, which can be a problem with older ductwork… Not enough returns, too small a diameter etc. Also with the AC component you probably want the majority of your air in different places. Ex in the winter we want most of the air and heat in our kitchen, living room and bathroom. In the summer we want most of our cool air in the bedrooms for comfortable sleeping. So you’ll likely want some louvers to make seasonal adjustments with. They’re also a bit less efficient than mini splits typically are, partially because of the ductwork. But if you’ve got the right ductwork for it then it can be a great retrofit. Guy who did ours said he never recommends them for new builds but for retrofits they work well. Our install was about 12k back then. Relatively high end unit, small amount of electrical work and some ductwork. My parents had one installed in N.S. a couple years ago for around 20k.

Cat and dog fur actually helps them regulate temperature, so shaving will be counter productive. Otherwise there are some good suggestions on here. I know it sucks and is expensive but with our regular heatwaves, even the smallest AC unit is really helpful for pets. I had to get one when I got a brachyphilic dog. Perhaps you have friends or family who you could arrange to stay with when the heatwaves come? Opening your windows at night and putting a fan in one to blow the cold night air in is super effective. Close the windows in the day to keep the heat out. I use a box fan I got at Canadian tire and put it on a smart plug so it’s completely automatic. Turns on after sunset and turns off at sunrise. My house was 25 inside yesterday afternoon and it was 35 outside in the shade. I have a water spray bottle (like the one they use in hair salons) and mist both my cat and dog throughout the day. They also have a dedicated fan. Minimize or if possible avoid using the stove and more importantly, the oven. Your home is their home too. Not you specifically, but there are a lot of shit pet owners out there who are selfish assholes and just do things willy-nilly with no regard how it will affect their pets. I freeze a couple tea towels and then put one over my kitty like a blanket. We have also done frozen bananas. If they like brushes you can wet a brush and then brush them with it. My kitties loved that. Damp towels on the floor(as others ha e suggested) and make sure there is plenty of water out. For my dog, I laid ice packs on his bed with towels underneath and on top of them. That seemed to help. I give my cat a big ice cube and pour a schlick of cat cream on it. She laps it up as it melts. Seems to work well to keep her cool, and plus side it keeps her hydrated. I feel you even my Chihuahua has retreated into the AC room at mine

 Trip to Big Dam for a swim during the hot weather last week.  One question. Is this a God dam? I thought this spot is called soldiers pond? Am I fucked up? Was there much glass around? Apparently there was last year based on the posts I saw. Didnt bother going up last summer because of that. How is it? Also a picture of the ghost of Big Dam via Google Earth. Where is this? It looks beautiful Was up there last week and it was the second warmest Ive EVER felt a swim hole in St.Johns It was LOVELY A gorgeous perspective we dont get much in St. Johns.

I would recommend getting a programmable thermostat, just so that you can set temps throughout the day and then not really need to worry about them again until the weather changes later. I have a nest thermostat and it has a little leaf on it when I adjust the temperature to an "efficient" temperature. My house has a lot of windows on the south facing side, so the sun heats my home during the day so I have the furnace low (19), then its set to go to 20.5 in the evening, then back to 19.5 over night. During the summer our furnace is usually switched off and we have an AC. The AC unit we keep at 1 temp throughout the day, if we turn it off to "save power" then it ends up taking sometimes hours to get back to that temperature and is running that entire time. "need to burn more gas to get back to a higher temperature" - this is a common sense fallacy. You burn more gas to keep an average 20 C all day long than having it at 18 then back to 20. The savings are minimal, though. Think of averages over 30 days. Instead of having 20 C average for 30 days, youll have 19 C. Simplistic math considering you have 12 hours at 18 and 12 hours at 20: \[(20 x 15) + (18 x 15)\] / 2 = 19 So, youd be saving your furnace to burn the equivalent of 1 C per day of gas. Get a programmable thermostat. Should not be more than 3 degree difference between night and day. I do 16 and 19 degrees. I dont worry about it and my heating bills are not extravagant, actually rather low.nice thing about a programme thermostat is you dont need to worry about turning off your furnace in summer. It simply wont kick in unless the temperature gets too low Shut the vent off. Easy fix.

 These northern Ontario homeowners are turning to heat pumps for energy savings  Amazing news. No extra cost and a big difference to the environment, if followed on a large scale. Plus he gets AC. They’ve been pushing heat pumps for over a decade, it’s honestly a farce. Heat pumps are good don’t get me wrong, but they are not the only good out there and not always the best option. Natural gas furnaces keep up if not surpass with an incredibly small carbon footprint. Particularly in areas where it actually gets cold (below -2 nevermind -7). And as the article states “cheaper than oil” no sh*t it’s cheaper than oil, an oil furnace is (thanks to taxation) one of the most expensive forms of heat for a longgg time.

################################################################################

Look for the diagnostic led light that blinks out error codes. Its often visible through the round glass inspection port on the front of the furnace. Determine what codes it is blinking out and look it up on the internet. It will flash out blinks that correspond to a number. For instance, constant slow or fast blinking means furnace is operating properly. 3 blinks = pressure switch problem. check for blockages in vent or drain. Hydro will come out and inspect your furnace for free. They may or may not fix it, depending on what it is. Change the battery in your thermostat!!! I’ve used Furnasman in the past and quite like them. This happened to me a couple of years ago, turned out to be the flame sensor. You can clean it yourself with a scour pad or steel wool, or replace it pretty cheaply. I had Furnasman come out, probably cost over $100 but they fixed it and showed me what to do next time. Call hydro they will book an appointment for you, also check your filter, check your exhaust pipe make sure its clear check your thermostat make sure its working and its heating mode. Could be possible your pilot light is out eventually call mb hydro if its not an emergency or if you are freezing I would say watch a video on relighting furnace or better hire a contractor. Check your furnace manual, is there a Pilot light? Sometimes, it is simple as it is turned off, if you are not comfortable to light it, call Hydro. Usually the manual will tell you how to light it safely. Is your fan running like a high speed? That means your filter is clogged and everything is probably stopped due to that, change the filter.

Im in Saskatchewan and going through my first winter with a heat pump and propane radiant floor heat and solar and Ill give you my thoughts Our price for natural gas is very cheap and our electrical rates are high ( compared to the rest of Canada ). Even if you have solar there likely wont be enough sun durring the winter to cover the power needed to run the heat pump If you have a regular furnace with natural gas and a/c dont bother with a heat pump not worth the added cost. If you have a house with gas radient heat then a heat pump is a great option for the shoulder seasons that the boilers struggle with If your heating with propane ,oil or wood then a heat pump is also going to be great option . Also realize there are many diffent kinds of heat pumps, only the inverter types are suitable for our climate , most manufactures have a different model of cold climate inverta as well.They are also the most expensive They need to be installed correctly to work properly here , above the snow and proper wind direction. Make sure the electricn know how to wire the properly ( shielded wire and surger suppressor ) I have the large whirlpool heat pump dryer and I think its great , its not that much more energy efficient but the fact that it doesnt vent outside is a big energy saving and I dont have an extra hole in the building envelope . Ill do a heat pump water heater when they come down in price, Im currently using about 1$ a day to heat water with an Electric tank . The free a/c from the tank durring the summer would be nice..... We had previously considered it in our last house but never went through with it as we ended up selling and moving. There are some grants available from the gov as well if you qualify. People have commented that we are too cold here for it to work properly though. So you may wish to look into that.

 Local mitsubishi heat pump expert.  Hi all, last spring we did a large renovation part of which included a new mitsubishi heat pump system (ducted and a single mini split). Weve been having some issues and concerns with it and although the contractor has been very receptive and helpful they havent been able to figure out what the root cause is of some of behavior. I was also surprised that these systems arent smart out of the box and require some creative creative work arounds to get them online (especially in Canada). I was hoping I could get some recommendations for installers/contractors who are knowledgable about Mitsubishi heat pumps I could contact for a Second Opinion if the original contractor fails to solve our issues. Bonus points if they have got them online for you. Thanks in advance. What’s the issue? Ive had some issues with my system as well...wasnt getting much help with the original installer. I believe they had some technician turnover. A friend recommended a company called Ignite Energy - the owner really nerds out about this kind of stuff and was really helpful. fixed some of my issues on the spot and will return for some additional work.
